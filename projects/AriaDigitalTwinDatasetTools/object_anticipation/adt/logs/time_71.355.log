    - object: Magazine04_1
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CandlePattern01_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Magazine04_1
      reason: This magazine has high focus (91 counts), high proximity consistency (51 counts), and a short time to approach (0.529 seconds), making it a prime candidate as it satisfies all thresholds.
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      reason: The cracker has a solid focus count (89 counts), a close distance (1.025 meters), and a reasonable time to approach (0.623 seconds), although it is slightly lower in focus, still making it a strong possibility.
    - object: CandlePattern01_1
      reason: The candle pattern has a strong focus count (80 counts) and good proximity (71 counts), but a longer time to approach (1.696 seconds). It meets focus and proximity thresholds but slightly exceeds the time threshold, keeping it probable.
