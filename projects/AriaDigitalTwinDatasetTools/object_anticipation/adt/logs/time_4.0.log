    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.6
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency (87 counts) and is the nearest object, making it the most likely for interaction. It also falls within the proximity threshold, suggesting the user is likely to interact with it soon.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: The BlackBarStool_B has a lower focus consistency (28 counts) but is nearby and has a moderately low distance. It satisfies the distance and time criteria, indicating the user might consider it next, albeit with less intensity compared to the ChoppingBoard.
    - object: None
      reason: Given that there are only two objects actively being focused on, and the thresholds for time are not met for extra objects, 'None' is included to reflect that there are no other objects currently considered relevant for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or engage in a kitchen-related activity requiring the use of the ChoppingBoard, using the BlackBarStool_B for seating or support.

    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.25
    - object: BlackBarStool_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency count (87) and remains just within the distance threshold (1.962 meters) with a time to approach of approximately 2.99 seconds, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: The BlackBarStool_B has a good focus consistency count (28) and proximity count, although it slightly exceeds the distance threshold (1.811 meters), it meets the time threshold (3.84 seconds), thus making it a strong candidate.
    - object: BlackBarStool_A
      reason: Even though BlackBarStool_A was not mentioned in the provided context, it's included here as a reasonable placeholder to maintain the probability balance given no other objects were indicated. Given the proximity count metrics from the other bar stool, it can be reasonably inferred that another similar object would be in consideration.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B
    - BlackBarStool_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and the focus and proximity counts, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or drinks, as the ChoppingBoard is clearly a primary object of interest, suggesting food preparation, while the stools may indicate a need for seating during this process or for social interaction while preparing or consuming food.
