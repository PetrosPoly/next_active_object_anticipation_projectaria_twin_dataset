2024-10-17 11:25:56,193 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork has the highest focus count (45) but does not meet the time threshold (2.30 seconds needed to approach). However, it is close to the user (1.922 meters), making it a probable choice for interaction due to its substantial focus.
    - object: WoodenBowl
      reason: The WoodenBowl also surpasses the focus threshold (44 counts) and lies within the distance threshold (1.578 meters). It does not meet the time threshold (1.787 seconds) but shows significant focus and proximity, indicating a likely interaction.
    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      reason: The NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon meets the distance and time thresholds, with a distance of 1.570 meters and a time to approach of 1.898 seconds. Its focus count (39) is slightly below the threshold, which places it as a probable object for the user to interact with.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WoodenFork
    - WoodenBowl
    - NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare or serve food or drink items, likely involving utensils and containers commonly used in a living room or dining context.
