    - object: Donut_B
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has the highest focus consistency (91 counts) and is within an optimal distance (1.457 meters) and time (1.825 seconds) to approach, indicating high likelihood of interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl shows strong focus consistency (86 counts) and is also close (1.382 meters) with an appropriate approach time (1.985 seconds), making it a very probable object for interaction.
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: Although CandleDishSmall does not exceed the time threshold, it has a high focus count (91 counts) and good proximity (1.521 meters), which support the possibility of interaction based on observed patterns.

    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has the highest focus count (91), is within a reasonable distance (1.457 meters), and has a low approach time (1.825 seconds), positioning it as the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl also has a high focus count (86), is close in proximity (1.382 meters), and has a reasonable approach time (1.985 seconds), making it a likely candidate for interaction as well.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: CakeMocha_A demonstrates a good focus count (78) and is accessible at a close distance (1.577 meters) with a moderate approach time (3.060 seconds), making it a plausible option for interaction.

      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.30
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      probability: 0.35

rationale:
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has the highest focus consistency count (91), indicating that the user has focused on it intensely over the last few moments. While its distance count is still within the proximity threshold, the high focus makes it a prime candidate for interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a strong focus count (86) and is very close to the user (1.382 meters), fulfilling the distance criteria. While its time to approach is marginally higher than the 2 seconds threshold, the combination of focus and proximity suggest a strong likelihood of interaction.
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: The CandleDishSmall shows a focus count of 91 and a distance of 1.521 meters. Despite the time to approach being slightly above the threshold, the consistent focus and close proximity indicate that it may be prioritized for interaction as the user moves around.

    - CandleDishSmall

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or selecting food items, as many of the highly focused objects are either food items or utensils associated with food preparation and serving.

    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has the highest focus count (91) and is within a close distance (1.457 meters) with a quick approach time of 1.82 seconds. This indicates that the user is very likely to interact with it.
    - object: GreenApple_A
      reason: GreenApple_A also demonstrates strong focus (89 counts) and a reasonable distance (1.645 meters) with an approach time under 2.1 seconds. This suggests that it is a probable candidate for interaction as well.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: While BlackCeramicBowl has a slightly lower focus count (86), it maintains a close distance (1.382 meters) and an approachable time under 2 seconds, making it a likely object for interaction.
