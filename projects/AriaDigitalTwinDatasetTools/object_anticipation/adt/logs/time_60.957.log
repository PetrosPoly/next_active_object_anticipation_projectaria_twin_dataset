    - object: Cereal_Anon
      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Cereal_Anon
      reason: "Cereal_Anon has the highest focus count (43), indicating strong attention from the user. Given the context of the living room and possible tasks related to food preparation, it is likely that the user will interact with this object."
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: "The WoodenSpoon has a high focus count (39) as well, suggesting that the user may intend to use it while preparing or serving food. Its presence alongside food-related items increases its likelihood of interaction."
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "With a focus count of 38, the MuffinPan is likely to be relevant to a cooking task. It's reasonable to infer that the user may be planning to bake or prepare food items, making this object a good candidate for interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Cereal_Anon
    - WoodenSpoon
    - MuffinPan

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is to engage in food preparation or cooking activities, possibly preparing a meal or snack in the living room environment.
