2024-10-17 11:22:44,675 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.45
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon has the highest focus consistency (59 counts), is within close proximity (0.873 meters), and has a short time to approach (1.88 seconds), making it the most likely object the user will interact with.
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: Jam_Anon shows significant proximity consistency (70 counts) and was also focused on (25 counts), though it has a longer time to approach (46.09 seconds). However, its strong proximity suggests elevated chances of interaction, placing it second in likelihood.
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: The WhiteFlatwareTray shows good focus consistency (28 counts) and proximity (68 counts), satisfying both focus and distance thresholds, although it has an approach time of 2.93 seconds. This combination makes it the third probable object for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WoodenSpoon
    - Jam_Anon
    - WhiteFlatwareTray

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or organize items in the living room, as indicated by the focus on kitchenware and food-related items like the WoodenSpoon and Jam_Anon.
2024-10-17 11:22:45,892 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:

      probability: 0.4
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon has the highest focus consistency count (59) and is also in close proximity (0.873 meters) to the user, which suggests that the user has been closely observing it. With a time to approach of 1.88 seconds, it meets the time threshold, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: The Jam_Anon has a focus consistency count of 25 and is very close (0.870 meters). However, it does not meet the time threshold (46.08 seconds), which suggests that it has been on the user’s mind but may require more preparation or movement to interact with. Still, its proximity and partial focus qualify it as the second most likely.
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: The WhiteFlatwareTray has a focus consistency count of 28 and is relatively close (0.984 meters) with a time to approach of 2.93 seconds. Although it barely meets the time threshold, its mix of focus and proximity still positions it as a probable object for interaction.

    - WoodenSpoon
    - Jam_Anon
    - WhiteFlatwareTray

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or serving food, given the focus on utensils and food items observed in previous interactions. The user may be in the process of making or serving a dish, where tools like the WoodenSpoon and items such as Jam_Anon are essential components.
