2024-09-06 16:25:00,397 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: WhiteChair
      probability: 0.37
    - object: BlackTablet
      probability: 0.33
    - object: ExtendableTable
      probability: 0.30

rationale:
    - object: WhiteChair
      reason: "The WhiteChair has the highest count in both the high focus (87) and nearby objects (58) lists, suggesting the user has spent considerable time observing and being close to it, indicating a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: BlackTablet
      reason: "The BlackTablet has a high focus count (35) and a nearby count (31), making it a strong candidate for interaction as it reflects both observation and proximity."
    - object: ExtendableTable
      reason: "The ExtendableTable has the second-highest focus count (62) and is likely to be a point of interest for the user as they may consider interacting with it for placing or organizing other objects."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WhiteChair
    - BlackTablet
    - ExtendableTable

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to organize, rest, or interact with objects in the living room, possibly preparing for a gathering or meal.

    - object: WhiteChair
      probability: 0.45
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.30
    - object: ExtendableTable
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteChair
      reason: "The WhiteChair has the highest count (87) in 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts', indicating the user has observed it the most intensely. This suggests a strong likelihood of interaction, possibly for seating or placing items."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug has a considerable focus count of 46, and it is also part of the nearby objects. This combined with its relevance for drinks leads to a high likelihood of interaction."
    - object: ExtendableTable
      reason: "The ExtendableTable has a focus count of 62, which, while lower than the WhiteChair, still indicates substantial interest. Its practical use for setting down items or providing a surface may drive the interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WhiteChair
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - ExtendableTable

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to either sit down or prepare to have a drink, potentially involving arranging items on the table or enjoying a beverage in the living room.
