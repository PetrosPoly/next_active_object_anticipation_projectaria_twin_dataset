    - object: Magazine04_1
      probability: 0.45
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      probability: 0.35
    - object: DinoToy
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: Magazine04_1
      reason: "It has the highest count of 76 in the high_focus_objects, indicating the user observed it intensely, suggesting a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: "While it is not the highest in focus counts, it consistently appears in previous predictions, indicating the user may have had intentions to engage with it at various times."
    - object: DinoToy
      reason: "Despite having fewer counts than others, it appears in close proximity with significant counts in the nearby_objects, indicating the user may be considering interaction with it as they move around."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Magazine04_1
    - BlackCeramicDishSmall
    - DinoToy

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to find and interact with objects for potential leisure activities, such as reading magazines or engaging with toys, possibly indicating a desire to relax or entertain in the Living Room.

rationale:
    - object: Magazine04_1
      reason: "This object has the highest focus count (76) which indicates a strong likelihood of interaction. The user has observed it intensely, suggesting they are interested in this magazine."
    - object: DinoToy
      reason: "Although this object has a lower focus intensity compared to Magazine04_1, it is the second highest among the nearby objects and has significant proximity counts. This indicates the user may be considering interacting with it."
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: "This object appears in previous predictions consistently and has been part of the user's recent focus, making it a probable choice for interaction even if its current count is lower than the first two choices."
