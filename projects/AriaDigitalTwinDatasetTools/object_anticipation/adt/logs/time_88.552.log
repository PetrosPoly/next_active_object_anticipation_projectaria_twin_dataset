    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Donut_B
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl meets the focus threshold with high counts, proximity threshold with significant counts, and has a time to approach that is just above the threshold. This indicates that the user has been consistently interacting with or observing this object in recent moments, making it highly probable they will engage with it.
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: The Donut_B also performs well against the criteria by meeting focus and distance thresholds, with reasonable proximity counts. Although it does not fully meet the time threshold, the proximity and focus values are strong, suggesting this object is next in line for interaction.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A meets the focus and proximity thresholds but does not meet the time threshold. However, its consistent presence in the user's focus suggests that it may be an object of interest, making it a probable choice for interaction.

    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - Donut_B
    - Mango_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare or serve food items, likely engaging with dishes and desserts as indicated by their focus on bowls and pastries.

    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Donut_B
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a high focus score (91) and is within a close distance (1.192 meters) with a relatively low approach time (1.714 seconds). This combination of high focus and proximity strongly suggests that the user is likely to interact with it.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: CakeMocha_A also has a high focus score (91) and remains at a decent proximity (1.423 meters), with a reasonable approaching time (2.540 seconds). This indicates the user is not only observing it but is also ready to approach, making it a strong candidate for interaction.
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has a focus count of 91, putting it in the next tier of likelihood. Although it has a slightly longer distance (1.227 meters) and approach time (1.709 seconds), its high focus consistency suggests that the user is very interested in it.

    - Donut_B

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or serve items, potentially involving the bowls and pastries as part of a meal or snack preparation process. The user appears to be focused on food-related interactions in the living room context.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: Donut_B
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has the highest focus consistency count (91), meets the distance threshold (1.192m), and has a reasonable approach time (1.714s), making it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B shows strong focus consistency (91) and reasonable proximity (1.227m) while also falling within the time threshold (1.709s). This suggests that the user is likely interested in this object.
    - object: Flask
      reason: The Flask has a focus count of 91, is within a close distance (1.599m), but has a longer approach time (2.578s). While it doesn't fully satisfy the time threshold, its high focus and close proximity indicate it is still a probable choice.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or serve food items, possibly for a meal or a gathering, as indicated by the focus on food-related objects like the BlackCeramicBowl and Donut_B.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: Donut_B
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has high focus consistency counts (91) and a moderate approach time (1.714 seconds), clearly indicating that the user is likely to interact with it. It also has a proximity count that suggests the user was nearby, meeting both focus and proximity thresholds while meeting time thresholds.
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B also has significant focus consistency (91) and a time to approach of 1.709 seconds, aligning well with both focus and time thresholds. Its proximity counts suggest that the user was close to it, making it a strong candidate for interaction.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: Although CakeMocha_A has lower proximity counts than the first two objects, it still meets a high focus count (91) and an acceptable time to approach (2.540 seconds). This suggests the user could still interact with it, especially since it is involved in their food or beverage-related task.
