rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a high focus count of 82, sufficient proximity count of 28, and an approach time of 1.636 seconds, which all exceed the thresholds. This makes it the top candidate for interaction.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A also has a favorable focus count of 78, distance count of 25, and a quick approach time of 1.795 seconds, meeting both the proximity and focus criteria. It is likely to be chosen next after the BlackCeramicBowl.
    - object: BlackCeramicDishLarge
      reason: The BlackCeramicDishLarge meets the focus threshold with a count of 82 and a proximity count of 28, and has a low approach time of 1.638 seconds. Despite not being as strong as the top two candidates, its overall metrics suggest it could still be a meaningful interaction point.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - Mango_A
    - BlackCeramicDishLarge

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or serving food, as indicated by their focus on bowls and fruits that may be used for cooking or meal presentation.
