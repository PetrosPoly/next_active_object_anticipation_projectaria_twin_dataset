    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus and proximity counts, indicating that the user observed it often and remained close to it, suggesting an intention to interact. Its approach time is also the shortest, making it a prime candidate for interaction.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon has a solid focus count and is located within close proximity to the user. Although it does not have the same level of focus as the KitchenKnife, it fulfills both the distance and time thresholds, suggesting itâ€™s also likely to be interacted with.
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      reason: The AirPurifier_1 shows a decent focus count and is within proximity, though it does not meet the time threshold for approach. However, it has been consistently observed, making it a possible target for user interaction in the current context.

    - AirPurifier_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food or engaging in activities that require the use of kitchen utensils, as indicated by the strong focus on kitchen-related items.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus consistency count (82) and is close in proximity (0.796 meters) with a low time to approach (1.238 seconds). These metrics indicate a strong likelihood of interaction.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon shows a solid focus count (66) and is also within a close range (0.847 meters), with an approach time of 2.031 seconds, making it a highly probable object for interaction based on proximity and focus.
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      reason: Although the AirPurifier_1 has a lower focus count (49) compared to the top two objects, it is still within reasonable proximity (1.025 meters) and has a time to approach (3.885 seconds) that is just above the threshold, which still gives it some likelihood of interaction.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus counts (82), is within proximity (0.796 meters), and has a reasonable approach time (1.238 seconds). These metrics suggest it is the most likely object the user intends to interact with, especially if they are preparing food or chopping ingredients.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon shows strong focus counts (66) and is also close to the user (0.847 meters) with an approach time of 2.031 seconds. Its metrics align well with the user's potential cooking activities, making it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      reason: Although it has lower focus counts (49), the AirPurifier is relatively close (1.025 meters) and can be relevant for maintaining air quality while cooking. Its approach time (3.885 seconds) exceeds the threshold, but focus and proximity suggest that it remains a probable interaction.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.35
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon has high focus (66 counts) and proximity (58 counts) while also meeting the time threshold (2.031 seconds) to approach. This makes it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has a high focus count (82 counts) and a feasible time to approach (1.238 seconds) but is just over the proximity threshold with 60 counts. This suggests the user is likely interested in using it soon.
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      reason: The AirPurifier_1 shows moderate focus (49 counts) and proximity (50 counts), and while it does not meet the time threshold (3.885 seconds), it has a reasonable distance. This combination keeps it in contention for interaction.
