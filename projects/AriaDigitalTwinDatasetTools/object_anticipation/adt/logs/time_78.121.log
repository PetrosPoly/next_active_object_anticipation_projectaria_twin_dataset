    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: While it does not meet the time threshold, the KitchenKnife has a high focus count and moderate proximity counts. It is essential for many food preparation tasks, making it a probable interaction even if it’s slightly lower in the ranks.

    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - ChoppingBoard
    - KitchenKnife

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food or a meal, as indicated by the focus on kitchen-related objects like the CoffeeCanisterLarge, ChoppingBoard, and KitchenKnife.
2024-10-17 11:28:49,405 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has the second highest focus count with 77, is within the proximity threshold (1.364 m), and has a short time to approach (1.26 seconds). It satisfies all thresholds making it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug has a strong focus count of 82, is within proximity (1.812 m), but slightly exceeds the time threshold (2.09 seconds). However, its high focus and reasonable distance contribute to its high probability of interaction.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard shows a high focus count of 83 and is within proximity (1.683 m). While it has a time to approach close to the threshold (2.06 seconds), its combined good focus and proximity make it a solid candidate for interaction.

    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - ChoppingBoard

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or enjoying a beverage, possibly involving movement among kitchen items for a drink or snack. The focus on the coffee canister and mug suggests an intention to make coffee or a related task, supplemented by the context of nearby cooking or serving items.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug has high focus consistency (82 counts) and is relatively close (1.812 meters), but does not meet the time threshold (over 2 seconds). Despite this, the combination of high focus and proximity suggests it is likely to be interacted with. 
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife also has high focus consistency (82 counts), but its distance measurement is 1.668 meters and it meets the time threshold of 2 seconds. This strong combination indicates a high probability of interaction.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has high focus counts (83) and is close as well (1.683 meters), but like the BlackCeramicMug, it does not meet the time threshold. Despite that, its significant focus suggests a strong likelihood of interaction.
