      probability: 0.35
    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.30
    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.35

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "With the highest count of 91 in high focus objects, the BlackCeramicBowl has attracted significant attention from the user, suggesting a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask has a count of 73 in the high focus category, indicating that the user has also observed it quite closely, making it another strong candidate for interaction."
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: "Despite having a slightly lower focus count of 85, the WoodenFork is also present among the nearby objects with a substantial count, suggesting the user is considering it for interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - Flask
    - WoodenFork

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or serve food or beverage using items primarily focused on or nearby the workspace associated with food preparation, indicated by the emphasis on bowls, utensils, and possibly pouring or serving drinks.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has the highest count in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list (91), indicating that the user has been observing it intensively. Its presence in the nearby_objects_measured_in_counts list also suggests prolonged proximity, making it a strong candidate for interaction."
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask also has a significant count in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list (73), indicating the user has directed attention toward it. Additionally, it appears among the nearby objects, enhancing the likelihood that the user may interact with it."
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: "The WoodenFork has a high count in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list (85), suggesting that the user is likely considering it for interaction. Although it did not appear in the nearby_objects list as prominently as the first two objects, the combination of its high focus count and proximity activity still makes it relevant."

      probability: 0.32

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has the highest count in the high focus list (91), indicating that the user has observed it intensely, suggesting a strong intention to interact with it."
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask has a significant focus count (73), and it is also present in the nearby objects list, indicating the user remains close to it for a considerable time, showing potential interest in using it."
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: "The WoodenFork has a focus count of 85, indicating it has garnered attention during the user's observations. Its presence in the nearby objects list further supports the likelihood of interaction."
