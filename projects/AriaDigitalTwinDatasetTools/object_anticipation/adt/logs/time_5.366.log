    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.45
    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest proximity consistency and is also the easiest to approach based on the time required. It satisfies both the focus and time thresholds, indicating strong potential for interaction.
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork meets the focus and distance thresholds while also having a decent time to approach. Its position and focus counts suggest that the user is likely planning to use the fork, especially if preparing food or eating.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A has a good focus count and a reasonable approach time, which indicates that it is a high-interest item for the user, although it does not meet the time threshold fully.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard meets the distance threshold (1.304 meters) and has a focus count clearly indicating the user's attentiveness. Additionally, it has the shortest time to approach (1.037 seconds), suggesting a high likelihood of interaction.
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork also meets the distance threshold (1.440 meters) and maintains consistent focus. Though its time to approach is slightly higher than the ChoppingBoard (1.747 seconds), it remains a strong candidate for interaction given its proximity and focus.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl meets the focus and distance thresholds, with notable consistency exhibited by the user. However, the longer time to approach (2.092 seconds) makes it slightly less probable compared to the other two objects but still a valid option.

    - ChoppingBoard
    - WoodenFork
    - BlackCeramicBowl

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to meal preparation or serving, utilizing these specific kitchenware items to assist in that process.

      probability: 0.45
    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard meets the distance (1.304 meters) and time (1.037 seconds) thresholds, indicating that the user is very close and can approach quickly. Its high focus count of 91 suggests that the user is consistently observing it, making it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A also meets the distance (1.468 meters) and time (1.836 seconds) thresholds, indicating proximity and reasonable time to approach. The focus count of 91 shows that the user is paying significant attention to it, making it the second most likely object for interaction.
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork meets the distance threshold (1.440 meters) and has a strong focus count. Although it falls slightly short of the time threshold, its close proximity and focus suggest that it is still a probable object for interaction.

      probability: 0.45
    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard meets the time threshold (1.037 seconds) and has significant focus counts (91), making it the most likely object for interaction. Its proximity consistency is also high, which suggests the user has spent considerable time near or focusing on it.
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork satisfies the time threshold (1.747 seconds) and has a high focus count (91), though its proximity count is slightly lower. This combination indicates a strong likelihood of interaction as the user is likely preparing to use it, especially if food preparation is the task.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A falls just short of the time threshold (1.836 seconds) but maintains high focus (91) and proximity counts (28). This suggests that while the user may not be ready to interact immediately, the fruit is still a likely candidate for upcoming interaction, possibly for consumption or preparation.

    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the best intersection of focus (91 counts), proximity (45 counts), and a low time to approach (approximately 1.037 seconds), making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork also demonstrates high focus (91 counts) and acceptable proximity (29 counts), combined with a reasonable time to approach (approximately 1.747 seconds), positioning it as a strong candidate for user interaction.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A has a significant focus count (91 counts) and a close distance (1.468 meters), although its time to approach (1.836 seconds) is slightly longer. This combination still renders it probable for interaction.
