2024-10-17 11:11:53,843 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.4
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard meets all the thresholds for focus (49 counts), proximity (91 counts), and approach time (2.69 seconds), making it the highest probable object for interaction.
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife also satisfies the focus (50 counts) and proximity (91 counts) thresholds and has a reasonable approach time (2.72 seconds), placing it as the second most likely object for interaction.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan meets the focus (67 counts) and proximity (91 counts) thresholds, with a suitable approach time (1.68 seconds), making it the third likely object for interaction, despite not meeting the time threshold as strictly as the others.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - KitchenKnife
    - MuffinPan

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or bake, as indicated by the focus on kitchen utensils and tools relevant to food preparation.
