    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: "The WhiteFlatwareTray has the highest focus count (85) and is also frequently close to the user, making it the most likely candidate for interaction."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "The Jam_Anon has a significant focus count (45) and a high nearby count (91), indicating that the user has shown considerable attention to it and may want to interact with it soon."
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard is in both the focus (75) and nearby (75) counts, showing it is consistently observed and proximate, suggesting the user may want to use it for preparation or serving."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WhiteFlatwareTray
    - Jam_Anon
    - ChoppingBoard

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare food, possibly involving serving items using the WhiteFlatwareTray, working with the Jam_Anon, and using the ChoppingBoard for cutting or preparing ingredients.

    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: "The WhiteFlatwareTray has the highest count in both the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' and 'nearby_objects_measured_in_counts' lists, indicating it has received significant attention and the user has remained close to it for a considerable duration."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "Jam_Anon is prominently featured in both the focus and nearby counts, suggesting a strong likelihood of needing to interact with it, potentially for spreading on the BambooPlate or engaging with related utensils."
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard has appreciable focus and proximity counts, implying the user may be preparing food and requires a stable surface for cutting or assembling ingredients."

    - WhiteFlatwareTray
    - Jam_Anon
    - ChoppingBoard

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare food or a meal, likely involving the arrangement of flatware and usage of ingredients like jam on appropriate serving or eating utensils.

rationale:
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: "The WhiteFlatwareTray has the highest count (85) in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list, indicating strong recent attention from the user."
    - object: BambooPlate
      reason: "The BambooPlate has a high count of 53 in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list and is also present in the nearby_objects_measured_in_counts list with a count of 91, suggesting both attention and proximity."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "Although the Jam_Anon has a lower attention count (45), it has a high count of 91 in the nearby_objects_measured_in_counts list, indicating the user may have lingered near it, suggesting it could be a candidate for interaction."
