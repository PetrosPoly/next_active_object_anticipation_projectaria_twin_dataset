2024-10-17 11:23:10,954 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: Donut_B
      probability: 0.6
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.25
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has the highest focus and proximity counts (18 and 15, respectively) and a time to approach of approximately 1.79 seconds, which is well within the acceptable thresholds. This strong combination makes it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: WhiteUtensilTray has previous focus counts that indicate consistent observation, and although it does not show current proximity counts that directly meet the thresholds, it has been featured in past observations indicating it might still be relevant to the user's goal.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: ChoppingBoard has been observed in the past predictions and has maintained consistent focus counts, although it lacks the direct proximity counts needed to meet the strict thresholds. It remains in the realm of probability based on its history with the user.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Donut_B
    - WhiteUtensilTray
    - ChoppingBoard

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare or enjoy a snack or meal, likely involving items related to food presentation or consumption in the living room, focusing on quick access items like a donut.
