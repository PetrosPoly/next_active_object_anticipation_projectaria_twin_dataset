    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Pestel
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan has the highest focus count (88) and proximity measurements showing it's within a short distance, indicating the user is likely preparing to bake or cook."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "Jam_Anon has a high focus count (87) and is within close proximity. This suggests the user may want to incorporate it into their cooking or baking recipe."
    - object: Pestel
      reason: "Pestel is also a high-focus object (86) and is close, indicating that the user may be planning to use it for grinding or mixing ingredients in their current task."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - MuffinPan
    - Jam_Anon
    - Pestel

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare a recipe, possibly involving baking items such as muffins, where they would need to use the muffin pan and jam while possibly mixing ingredients using the pestel.
