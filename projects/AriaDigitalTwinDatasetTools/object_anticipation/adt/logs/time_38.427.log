2024-10-17 11:11:43,049 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon meets all thresholds for focus (54 counts), proximity (64 counts), and time (1.76 seconds), indicating a high likelihood of interaction as it has been consistently in the userâ€™s focus and is close enough for immediate access.
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: The Jam_Anon also shows significant focus (25 counts) and proximity (65 counts), along with a time to approach that exceeds the threshold (5.35 seconds). While it doesn't meet the time requirement, its strong proximity and reasonable focus counts suggest that it is a probable candidate for interaction.
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: The WhiteFlatwareTray has a solid focus count (23 counts), is very close (1.00 meter), and meets the time threshold (2.57 seconds). It falls into the category of objects that show potential for immediate interaction since the proximity suggests ease of access.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WoodenSpoon
    - Jam_Anon
    - WhiteFlatwareTray

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food, possibly involving the usage of cooking utensils (WoodenSpoon) and condiments (Jam_Anon). The focus on flatware (WhiteFlatwareTray) may indicate a preparation for serving or organizing items for a meal.
