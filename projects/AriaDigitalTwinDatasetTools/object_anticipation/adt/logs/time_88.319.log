2024-10-17 11:13:38,618 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Donut_B
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has the highest focus consistency (91 counts), good proximity consistency (43 counts), and a relatively short time to approach (1.986 seconds). It satisfies all thresholds, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: The Donut_B also shows a high focus consistency (91 counts) and decent proximity (36 counts), with a time to approach of 1.679 seconds. It meets both focus and distance thresholds, positioning it as the second most likely object the user will interact with.
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: This object has a strong focus consistency (91 counts) and good proximity (42 counts), with a time to approach of 1.987 seconds. Although it slightly overlaps with the time threshold, it still falls within a reasonable range and shows potential for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - Donut_B
    - BlackCeramicDishSmall

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food or setting a table, as they are focusing on kitchenware and food items within the living room setting.
