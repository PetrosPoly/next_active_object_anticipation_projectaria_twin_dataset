    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: The WhiteFlatwareTray has the highest focus count (58) and is within a reasonable distance (1.734 meters), making it the most probable object of interaction. It also has an acceptable approach time (2.785 seconds), indicating that the user is likely to engage with it soon.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug has a strong focus count (52) and is also relatively close (1.418 meters), meeting both the focus and proximity criteria. Its approach time (2.238 seconds) shows itâ€™s a feasible option for interaction.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has a considerable focus count (57) and is also within a close range (1.280 meters). While its approach time (1.912 seconds) is acceptable, it faces some competition from the other two objects, leading to a slightly lower probability.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WhiteFlatwareTray
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - MuffinPan

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food or engaging in a cooking process, potentially involving the use of various kitchen tools and serving items.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: The White Flatware Tray has the highest focus consistency with 58 counts, exceeds the focus threshold, is within 1.734 meters (which is well within the proximity threshold), and has a reasonable time to approach of 2.785 seconds. This makes it highly probable that the user will interact with it next.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The Black Ceramic Mug shows strong focus consistency at 52 counts, is within reasonable proximity at 1.418 meters, and has a time to approach of 2.238 seconds. While it doesn't fully meet the time threshold, its other metrics suggest high likelihood of interaction.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The Muffin Pan has a focus count of 57 and is within a distance of 1.280 meters, with a time to approach of 1.912 seconds. While it meets the focus and distance thresholds, it is slightly below the time threshold, making it a probable choice for interaction.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or serve something involving the use of kitchen items, possibly for a snack or meal, as indicated by their focus on flatware and cooking utensils.

    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Mortar
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: The WhiteFlatwareTray has the highest focus count (58), indicating that the user has been observing it closely. Additionally, it is within close proximity, at 1.734 meters, which contributes to its high likelihood of interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug displays a strong focus count (52) and is also nearby at 1.418 meters. This suggests that the user has a consistent interest in this object and may want to interact with it next.
    - object: Mortar
      reason: Although the Mortar has a slightly lower focus count (47), it remains in relatively close proximity (1.414 meters). Its proximity means the user could be considering it, despite not being their primary focus.

    - WhiteFlatwareTray
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - Mortar

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to food preparation or serving, as evidenced by the focus on kitchenware items like the WhiteFlatwareTray, BlackCeramicMug, and Mortar. The presence of other cooking-related items also reinforces this conclusion.
