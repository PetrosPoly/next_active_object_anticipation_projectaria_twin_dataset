      reason: The TvRemote_1 also meets the distance threshold and has a short approach time of 2.555 seconds, with a focus count of 77. While it is slightly less probable than the DvdRemote_1, it remains a valid option as the user is still showing interest and proximity.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ToothbrushHolder
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to navigating entertainment options, possibly indicating preparation for watching a movie or cleaning up in the living room environment. The presence of the remotes also suggests engagement with media consumption.
2024-10-17 11:28:28,694 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      probability: 0.4
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      reason: The ToothbrushHolder meets the focus and distance thresholds with consistent high counts (91 focus counts, proximity of 1.502 meters, and approach time of 1.843 seconds), indicating that the user is likely paying close attention and is within a short distance for interaction.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: The DvdRemote_1 meets the distance and time thresholds with a proximity of 1.535 meters and a relatively short time to approach of 2.573 seconds, along with significant focus (76 counts). This makes it a strong candidate since the user is consistently nearby and likely considering interaction.
