    - object: KitchIsland
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.30
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchIsland
      reason: The KitchIsland has the highest focus and proximity consistency counts, indicating that the user is both focused on and close to this object. Additionally, the time to approach is within the threshold, making it highly probable that the user will interact with it.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard also has strong focus and proximity counts, similar to the KitchIsland. Though slightly lower in proximity counts, it retains high relevance, and the approaching time is sufficient, suggesting interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug shows a good balance of proximity and focus counts. While it is slightly less favored in focus comparison to the first two objects, it meets the proximity and focus thresholds well enough to be a probable candidate for interaction.

    - KitchIsland
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackCeramicMug

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or serve food or beverages in the living room, potentially involving cooking or creating a meal where the KitchIsland, ChoppingBoard, and BlackCeramicMug play essential roles in the task.

    - object: KitchIsland
      probability: 0.4
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchIsland
      reason: The KitchIsland has the highest proximity (91 counts) and is within a moderate close distance (1.771 meters), making it highly probable for interaction. It also has substantial focus counts (91), indicating that the user frequently observes it.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard is very close (0.908 meters) and has significant focus (88 counts), making it another strong candidate for interaction. It meets the distance and focus thresholds clearly, indicating that it is highly relevant to the user's task.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug has considerable focus (89 counts) and is in close proximity (1.163 meters), though it slightly misses the time threshold (3.032 seconds). Its high focus count indicates that it’s part of the user’s attention, pointing towards potential interaction.

    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackCeramicMug

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food or a beverage, given the focus on kitchen-related objects, kitchenware, and potential baking or cooking activities.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: KitchIsland
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus count (88) and a close proximity consistency count. It is also within the required distance, making it highly probable that the user will interact with it.
    - object: KitchIsland
      reason: The KitchIsland has an excellent focus count (91) and proximity. Although the user is slightly farther from it, the overall counts suggest significant engagement and intent to use it next.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug has a respectable focus count (89) and is also nearby, which indicates it could be used soon, though it is slightly less probable than the first two.

    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchIsland
      reason: The KitchIsland has the highest proximity counts and consistent focus counts, demonstrating that the user has been both close to and intensely observing this object. Additionally, it has an acceptable approach time, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard also shows high proximity and focus counts, indicating it is a focal point for the user. Its approach time is under the threshold, which further reinforces the likelihood of interaction, just behind the KitchIsland.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: While the BlackCeramicMug has lower focus counts than the first two objects, it still meets the distance and time thresholds. This makes it a good candidate for interaction, especially since the user is in close proximity to it.
