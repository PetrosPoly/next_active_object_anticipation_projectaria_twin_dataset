2024-10-17 11:10:59,617 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.4
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has the highest count in focus consistency (54) and is also within a close distance (1.739 meters), making it highly probable for interaction. Additionally, it is frequently observed by the user, suggesting a significant interest in it.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard meets both the focus (52 counts) and distance (1.935 meters) thresholds closely, indicating it is another highly probable object for interaction. Its proximity suggests the user may have a specific activity in mind that involves this object.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: While the BlackBarStool_B has a focus count of 51 and is close (1.995 meters), its time to approach is slightly lower than the threshold, placing it in the next tier of probability. However, its consistent visibility to the user suggests it may still be relevant to their current task.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - RedClock
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to organizing or checking items, possibly in preparation for a task in the living room area, such as meal preparation or setting a timer for an activity. The repeated focus on time-related objects (like the RedClock) further suggests attention to time management in their tasks.
