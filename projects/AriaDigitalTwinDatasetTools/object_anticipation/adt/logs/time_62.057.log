2024-10-08 01:02:42,505 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.35
    - object: GreenApple_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "Tomato_A has the highest focus count (65) and is nearby with a distance of 1.017 meters. This combination indicates strong engagement and a likely intent to interact."
    - object: Flask
      reason: "Flask shows significant focus (58 counts) and is within a close distance (1.114 meters), suggesting that the user may be preparing to use or examine the Flask closely."
    - object: GreenApple_A
      reason: "Although GreenApple_A has lower focus counts (14), it is the closest object at 0.937 meters, indicating potential interaction despite the lesser focus data."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Tomato_A
    - Flask
    - GreenApple_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely centered around food preparation or consumption, as indicated by the repeated presence of food-related items such as Tomato_A and GreenApple_A.
