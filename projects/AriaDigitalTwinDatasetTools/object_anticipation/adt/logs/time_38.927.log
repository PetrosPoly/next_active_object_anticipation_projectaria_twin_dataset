2024-10-17 11:26:19,538 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Pestel
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon has the highest focus consistency (69 counts) and a proximity consistency of 79 counts, indicating the user has likely focused on this object for a substantial amount of time while being close to it (0.821 meters away). It also has a low time to approach (1.746 seconds), making it highly probable that the user will interact with it soon.
    - object: Pestel
      reason: The Pestel shows significant focus counts (22 counts) and an exceptionally high proximity consistency of 68 counts. Although its focus count is slightly below the threshold, it is still within a reasonable range, and it is the second closest object at 0.922 meters. The proximity suggests that it is within reach for interaction, coupled with a reasonable approach time of 3.869 seconds.
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: Despite lower focus counts (25 counts), Jam_Anon has high proximity counts (80 counts) and remains within a close distance (0.890 meters). It achieves the proximity and some focus threshold yet does not meet the time threshold, which still places it as a less likely interaction but still a possible choice for the user.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WoodenSpoon
    - Pestel
    - Jam_Anon

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare or cook something in the living room, which may involve using the WoodenSpoon for mixing or stirring, the Pestel for crushing ingredients, and the Jam_Anon for adding flavor or texture to the dish.
