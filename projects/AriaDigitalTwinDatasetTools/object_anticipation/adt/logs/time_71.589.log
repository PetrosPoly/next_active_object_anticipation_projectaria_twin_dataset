      probability: 0.4
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Magazine03_2
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Magazine04_1
      reason: This object has high focus counts (86) and is within the proximity threshold (1.234 meters). Additionally, it has a short approach time (0.625 seconds), making it a strong candidate for immediate interaction.
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      reason: The Cracker_Anon has substantial focus (82 counts) and is very close to the user (0.989 meters), with a quick approach time of 1.044 seconds. Its high proximity and focus counts indicate it is likely to be the next object the user interacts with.
    - object: Magazine03_2
      reason: This object has a high focus count (91 counts) but is further away at 1.326 meters. It still meets the focus and partial distance criteria, although it slightly misses the time threshold. Given its prominence in the user's focus, it remains a probable interaction target.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Magazine04_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Magazine03_1
      reason: Magazine03_1 has high focus counts (91) and a decent proximity count (53). Although it exceeds the threshold for focus and meets the distance threshold, it falls within the time threshold at 1.86 seconds to approach. This strong combination of focus and proximity suggests a high likelihood of interaction.
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      reason: Cracker_Anon has high focus counts (82) and an excellent proximity count (77). While it is very close and readily approachable in just about 1 second, it satisfies the focus threshold but meets the distance threshold more closely, making it a likely candidate for the user's interaction.
    - object: Magazine04_1
      reason: Magazine04_1 has solid focus counts (86) and meets the distance threshold (1.234 meters). It can be approached in approximately 0.66 seconds, which indicates a quick interaction opportunity. Although it lacks higher proximity counts compared to the first two, its overall favorable metrics make it a plausible target for interaction.

    - Magazine03_1
    - Cracker_Anon
    - Magazine04_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and past ones, it is inferred that the user is likely engaged in browsing or selecting reading materials, particularly magazines and snacks, as evidenced by the interaction focus on various magazines and the Cracker_Anon, suggesting a goal related to leisure or casual consumption in the living room environment.

    - object: CandlePattern03_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Magazine03_1
      reason: It has high focus counts (91) and just meets the distance (1.355m) and time thresholds (1.864 seconds), making it a strong candidate for interaction.
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      reason: This object shows high proximity consistency (77 counts), satisfies the proximity threshold, and has a low time to approach (1.044 seconds), indicating a strong likelihood for interaction despite lower focus counts.
    - object: CandlePattern03_1
      reason: Although it doesn't meet the time threshold, it has a good level of focus (73 counts) and proximity (80 counts) which indicates a potential interaction in the future.
