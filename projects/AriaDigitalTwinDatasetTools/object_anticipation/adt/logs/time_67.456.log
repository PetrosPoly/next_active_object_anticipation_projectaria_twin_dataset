2024-10-17 11:23:54,274 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: BlackArmChair
      probability: 0.5
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.3
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: BlackArmChair
      reason: The BlackArmChair has the highest focus counts (30) and proximity counts (15), indicating that the user is both observing and physically close to it, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock shows a consistent presence in past predictions and is likely of interest to the user as time is usually relevant in daily tasks; it did not meet the time threshold but has shown consistent focus and proximity in the past.
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: Although the CoffeeCanisterLarge also didn't meet the time threshold, it has appeared frequently in past interactions, suggesting it's a probable candidate for future interactions when the user is within close range.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackArmChair
    - RedClock
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely focused on relaxing or managing time efficiently in the living room, possibly indicating a desire to take a break or check the time while engaging with their environment.
