      probability: 0.35
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.30
    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "This object has the highest count of 91 in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list, indicating that the user has observed it intensely for a significant portion of their time in the room."
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard has a count of 74 in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list and a nearby count of 31. Its proximity and focus metrics suggest the user might want to interact with it, especially if they are preparing food."
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: "With a count of 89 in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts', the Mango_A is also highly observed. Along with being a potential food item, its attention might indicate the user plans to use it in food preparation or consumption."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - ChoppingBoard
    - Mango_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or serve food, potentially using the BlackCeramicBowl to hold a dish or ingredients, the ChoppingBoard for cutting or prepping, and the Mango_A as an ingredient for the meal.

    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicDishLarge
      probability: 0.30
    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.35

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has the highest attention count at 91, indicating significant focus and potential intent to interact. Its high count suggests the user might be considering it for their task."
    - object: BlackCeramicDishLarge
      reason: "This object also has a high focus count of 91, similar to the BlackCeramicBowl. This proximity in counts indicates that it may be equally important for the user's current task."
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: "The WoodenFork has the same focus count of 91, suggesting that the user has been paying close attention to it. Its presence in the high focus list indicates a likelihood of interaction, especially if the user is preparing or serving food."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - BlackCeramicDishLarge
    - WoodenFork

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is likely to prepare or serve food, possibly involving the use of the bowls and utensils observed.

      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has the highest focus count of 91, indicating significant attention from the user, likely signifying intent to use it."
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: "Mango_A has a high focus count of 89, suggesting the user is likely considering it for interaction, possibly in relation to food preparation."
    - object: BlackCeramicDishLarge
      reason: "With a focus count of 91 and being among the top observed objects, the BlackCeramicDishLarge is likely important to the user's current task, possibly for serving."

    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - Mango_A
    - BlackCeramicDishLarge

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or serve food, as indicated by their focus on various food-related items and dishware in the living room.

      probability: 0.30
    - object: BlackCeramicDishLarge
      probability: 0.24

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has the highest observation count, indicating a strong focus by the user, suggesting a high likelihood of interaction."
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: "Mango_A has a high observation count as well, and since it falls within the top objects that the user was focused on, its relevance for interaction is also significant."
    - object: BlackCeramicDishLarge
      reason: "The BlackCeramicDishLarge is tied with high observation counts, and given its position as one of the most observed objects, it would likely be an object of interest."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - Mango_A
    - BlackCeramicDishLarge

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or serve food, as they are closely engaged with various serving and food-related items in the living room.

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: "The BlackCeramicDishSmall has the highest focus count (91), indicating it was observed intensively by the user, suggesting a likely intention to interact with it."
    - object: WoodenBowl
      reason: "The WoodenBowl has a significant focus count (82) and is also nearby, which increases the likelihood of interaction due to the user's prolonged proximity."
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: "Mango_A has a nearly equal focus count (89) and is likely essential for the user's task, contributing to its high probability of interaction despite being slightly lower than the other two."
