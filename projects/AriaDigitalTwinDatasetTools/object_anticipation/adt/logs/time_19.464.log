    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ConsoleTable
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus consistency (75 counts) and a relatively close distance (0.875 meters). Additionally, it has a low time to approach (0.916 seconds), making it a strong candidate for immediate interaction as the user likely needs it for a task requiring cutting or food preparation.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon has a good focus consistency (66 counts) and is also nearby (0.921 meters). Though it doesn't have the highest focus, it falls within a strong range for proximity and approach time (1.353 seconds), indicating the user might need it after the KitchenKnife, perhaps for stirring or serving.
    - object: ConsoleTable
      reason: The ConsoleTable maintains decent focus counts (72) and is a bit farther away (1.565 meters) compared to the other two objects. Despite satisfying the focus and distance criteria, it does not quite meet the time threshold as effectively. However, its prior attention suggests it might be part of the user’s intended interaction sequence.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - KitchenKnife
    - WoodenSpoon
    - ConsoleTable

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to cooking or preparing food, as evidenced by the strong focus on kitchen utensils and tools. The user seems to be engaged in a task that involves using these objects in a sequence, indicating a culinary activity.

      probability: 0.45
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ConsoleTable
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus and proximity counts, indicating the user is consistently observing and is very close to it, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon also has high focus and decent proximity counts, suggesting the user is likely considering using it soon, positioned next in order of likelihood for interaction.
    - object: ConsoleTable
      reason: Although the ConsoleTable has lower focus counts than the KitchenKnife and WoodenSpoon, it meets the distance and time thresholds, rendering it a viable option for potential interaction.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or organizing food items or tasks in the kitchen, indicated by their focus on kitchen utensils and proximity to the workspace in the living area.

      probability: 0.45
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ConsoleTable
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus and proximity consistency counts, indicating that the user is highly aware of and close to this object. Additionally, it has a very short time to approach, making it the most likely candidate for interaction.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon also shows significant focus and proximity counts, though slightly lower than the KitchenKnife. Its short distance and reasonable time to approach further enhance its likelihood for interaction, making it the second most probable object.
    - object: ConsoleTable
      reason: Although the ConsoleTable has lower focus and proximity counts compared to the first two objects, it meets the distance threshold while being within the user’s observation range. Therefore, it still holds a reasonable probability of being interacted with.
