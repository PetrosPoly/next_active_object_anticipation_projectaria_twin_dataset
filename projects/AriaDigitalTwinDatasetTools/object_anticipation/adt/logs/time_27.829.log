    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BambooPlate
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan has the highest focus consistency (59 counts) and is within close proximity (0.979 meters) with a reasonable time to approach (1.936 seconds), making it the most probable object for interaction."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug shows strong focus consistency (43 counts) and is reasonably close (1.340 meters) with an approachable time of 5.152 seconds. This proximity, combined with focus, elevates its likelihood for interaction."
    - object: BambooPlate
      reason: "The BambooPlate has good focus consistency (64 counts) and an approach time of 8.373 seconds, but is slightly further away (1.222 meters) compared to the previous objects. Its strong focus still makes it probable for user interaction."

      probability: 0.45
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BambooPlate
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan meets both the distance and time thresholds and has a high focus consistency of 59 counts. This indicates that the user has been focusing on it significantly and is likely to interact with it soon.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug satisfies the distance threshold well (1.34 meters) and has a decent focus consistency (43 counts). Although it doesn't meet the time threshold, its proximity and focus suggest a likelihood of interaction, likely to grab a drink while preparing food.
    - object: BambooPlate
      reason: The BambooPlate also does not meet the time threshold but has good focus (64 counts) and is at a reasonable distance (1.22 meters). This implies it could be an object of interest, possibly for food presentation.

    - object: KitchIsland
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has a high focus consistency (59 counts) and a close proximity (0.979 meters). It also has a short approach time of 1.93 seconds, indicating the user is likely to interact with it shortly.
    - object: KitchIsland
      reason: KitchIsland has a focus consistency of 55 counts and is very close (1.825 meters) with an approach time of about 3.68 seconds. While it doesn't surpass the MuffinPan in focus counts, its proximity still makes it a strong candidate for interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug shows moderate focus (43 counts) and proximity (1.34 meters), along with an approach time of 5.15 seconds. Although less likely than the first two, it is still probable given the thresholds and context.

    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has the highest focus consistency count (59) and a low distance (0.979 meters) with a short approach time (1.936 seconds). It meets all thresholds indicating the user is highly likely to interact with it.
    - object: KitchIsland
      reason: The KitchIsland also has a strong focus consistency count (55) and is close in proximity (1.825 meters) with a reasonable approach time (3.683 seconds). It meets the distance and focus criteria, placing it as the second most likely object for interaction.
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: The WhiteFlatwareTray has a good focus consistency count (73) and a distance of 0.962 meters, but a longer approach time (9.581 seconds) which means it does not meet the time threshold. However, its strong focus and proximity suggest that it is still a probable interaction target.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or serve food, possibly baking or making a meal, as indicated by their focus on kitchen-related items like the MuffinPan and KitchIsland.

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan

    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: The WhiteFlatwareTray also meets the distance and focus criteria with a focus count of 73, being close (0.962 meters), though the time to approach (9.581 seconds) exceeds the threshold. It is still likely to be interacted with due to high focus and proximity.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug has a reasonable focus count (43) and is a bit farther away (1.340 meters) with a longer time to approach (5.151 seconds). While it does not fully meet the time threshold, it still shows reasonable proximity and focus, making it a less likely but possible option for interaction.
