    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteVase
      probability: 0.30
    - object: CandlePattern01_2
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "Tomato_A has a high count of 91 in the nearby_objects list, indicating the user has spent significant time near it. It also appeared frequently in previous predictions, showing consistent interest."
    - object: WhiteVase
      reason: "WhiteVase has a count of 91 in the nearby_objects list and 83 in the high_focus_objects list, suggesting the user has been closely observing it. Its consistent appearance in previous predictions highlights a likely intention to interact."
    - object: CandlePattern01_2
      reason: "CandlePattern01_2 has a strong presence in the high_focus_objects list with 46 counts indicating notable observation time. This, combined with its proximity from the nearby_objects list, suggests a substantial likelihood of interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Tomato_A
    - WhiteVase
    - CandlePattern01_2

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to gather or interact with items that may be used for decoration or preparing food, as indicated by repeated focus on both decorative items and food-related objects.

    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.32
    - object: CandlePattern01_2
      probability: 0.31

rationale:
    - object: WhiteVase
      reason: "The WhiteVase has the highest count in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list at 83, indicating significant attention from the user, suggesting a high likelihood of interaction."
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "Tomato_A has a strong presence in both 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' (67 counts) and 'nearby_objects_measured_in_counts' (91 counts), highlighting both focused observation and prolonged proximity."
    - object: CandlePattern01_2
      reason: "While CandlePattern01_2 has a lower count (46) in the focus list, its proximity measurement suggests the user has been near it enough (46 counts) to consider it an object of interest potentially tied to their current task."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WhiteVase
    - Tomato_A
    - CandlePattern01_2

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to arrange decorative items in the living room, possibly involving selecting a vase and complementary objects such as the tomato or candles to enhance the aesthetic of the space.

    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.30

      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteVase
      reason: "The WhiteVase has the highest count (83) in the high_focus_objects list, indicating that it has been observed intensely for a significant amount of time, suggesting a strong intention to interact."
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "Tomato_A has a high count (67) in the high_focus_objects list and is also in the nearby_objects list (91), showing that the user has not only focused on it but also remained near it, increasing the likelihood of interaction."
    - object: CandlePattern01_2
      reason: "CandlePattern01_2 has a substantial count (46) in the high_focus_objects list, and while it is lower than the others, it still indicates considerable attention, combined with its presence in the vicinity, suggests potential interaction."

    - WhiteVase
    - Tomato_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to select items for decoration or arrangement in the Living Room, possibly preparing for an event or enhancing the aesthetic of the space, as indicated by the interest in decorative objects like vases and candles, along with food-related items like tomatoes, which could be part of a setup or a gathering.
