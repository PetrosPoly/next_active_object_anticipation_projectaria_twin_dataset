2024-10-17 11:10:06,740 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.6
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.25
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency (91 counts), indicating that the user has been observing it intently. Additionally, the proximity count (13 counts) suggests the user has spent time close to it, and the time to approach (approximately 1.95 seconds) is well within the threshold. This makes it highly probable that the user will interact with it.
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge was one of the objects noted in the past predictions, indicating it might be relevant to the user's task. While it does not have as high a focus count as the ChoppingBoard, it is still within a reasonable distance and could be a likely choice if the user intends to prepare something that requires coffee.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: Similar to the CoffeeCanisterLarge, the WhiteUtensilTray was part of the user's past interactions. While it shows lower focus and proximity counts, it is conceivable that the user might need utensils alongside the ChoppingBoard, making it a possible but less likely choice for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - WhiteUtensilTray

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to food preparation, as they are focused on objects typically associated with cooking activities.
