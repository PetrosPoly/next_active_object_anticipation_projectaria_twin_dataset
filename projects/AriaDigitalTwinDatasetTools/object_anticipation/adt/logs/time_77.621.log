    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.4
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has the highest focus count (70), which indicates that the user has observed it frequently. Despite the distance being slightly further than others, its high focus suggests strong interest or intention to interact, making it the most likely object.
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has a substantial focus count (62) and is also within a similar distance to the RedClock. It also has a relatively low time to approach (1.71 seconds), which increases the likelihood of interaction. 
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: Although the WhiteUtensilTray has a slightly lower focus count (50), it remains close to the user, and its time to approach is comparable (1.62 seconds). This makes it a probable choice for interaction, although less so than the first two.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - RedClock
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - WhiteUtensilTray

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or interacting with objects in the living room, specifically checking the time or organizing items related to coffee or utensils since those are the most focused objects in the user's vicinity.

    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has the highest focus count (70) and has a distance that is within the acceptable range (1.640 meters). It also has a short time to approach (2.028 seconds), satisfying all the thresholds, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge also shows a high focus count (62) and is only slightly further away (1.677 meters) than the RedClock. Its approach time is reasonable as well (1.715 seconds), meaning it qualifies under distance and focus, making it a very likely candidate for interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The WhiteUtensilTray has a focus count of 50 which is still considerable, and is similarly placed in proximity (1.653 meters) with an approach time of 1.625 seconds. While not as strong as the first two objects, it meets criteria in focus and proximity.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - RedClock
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - WhiteUtensilTray

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to check the time with the RedClock, possibly prepare or retrieve coffee from the CoffeeCanisterLarge, and utilize utensils stored in the WhiteUtensilTray, suggesting a routine morning or snack preparation activity in the living room.

      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has high focus consistency (62 counts) and is within 1.677 meters, which indicates it has a strong likelihood of interaction. It also has a relatively low time to approach (1.71 seconds), making it the most probable object the user will interact with.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock shows a strong focus consistency (70 counts) and is within a distance of 1.640 meters. However, it has a longer time to approach (2.03 seconds) compared to the CoffeeCanisterLarge, making it slightly less likely but still very probable for interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The WhiteUtensilTray has a good focus consistency (50 counts) and is within a distance of 1.653 meters, with a time to approach of 1.62 seconds. Although it is less focused upon compared to the first two objects, it still meets the distance and time criteria well enough to be considered a likely interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - WhiteUtensilTray

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare a drink or snack, possibly involving measuring ingredients or checking the time, given the focus on the coffee canister and the clock.

rationale:
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has the highest focus consistency (70 counts), is within proximity (0.64 meters), and requires only 2.03 seconds to approach, making it a strong candidate for interaction.
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge also has a high focus consistency (62 counts) and is close (1.68 meters), needing 1.71 seconds to approach, placing it prominently for potential interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The WhiteUtensilTray, while slightly lower in focus consistency (50 counts), still meets the proximity and time criteria, making it a viable option for the user.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to organizing or preparing for an activities involving timing (as suggested by the RedClock) and possibly food or drink preparation (hinted by the CoffeeCanisterLarge and WhiteUtensilTray).
