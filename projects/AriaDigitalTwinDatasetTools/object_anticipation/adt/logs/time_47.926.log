    - object: Donut_B
      probability: 0.4
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has the highest focus count (48) and a proximity count (45) that meet both distance and time thresholds, indicating a strong likelihood of interaction. The time to approach (0.86 seconds) also suggests that the user can quickly reach this object.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 meets the distance and time thresholds with a focus count of 46. This suggests that the user has spent considerable time observing this object, making it a likely candidate for interaction. The approaching time (1.46 seconds) also supports quick accessibility.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: TvRemote_1 has a focus count (45) that is close to meeting the threshold and a proximity count (25) that meets the distance threshold. Although it doesn't fully meet the time threshold, it is nearby and has been consistently in the user's focus, posing a reasonable chance of interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Donut_B
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to engage with various objects in the living room, possibly for leisure activities, such as snacking (indicated by a focus on Donut_B) or operating media equipment (evidenced by the attention towards the remotes).

    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has the highest focus consistency (48 counts) and meets the proximity (45 counts) and time threshold (0.85 seconds) for approach. This indicates that the user has been showing significant interest in this object and is very close to it.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 meets the proximity (27 counts) and time threshold (1.46 seconds) while also having a high focus count (46). This indicates that the user has been observing it closely while remaining within a suitable distance.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: TvRemote_1 has a strong focus count (45) and satisfies the proximity (25 counts) but falls slightly short of the time threshold (1.52 seconds). However, like other remote controls, its proximity and focus imply an intent to use it soon.

    - Donut_B
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to enjoy a snack (specifically the donut) while possibly engaging with media via the TV or DVD, indicating a desire to relax or entertain themselves in the living room.

    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has the highest focus count of 48, indicating that the user has been intensely observing it. It also has a good proximity count of 45 and a low approach time of 0.86 seconds, which places it well within thresholds for high interaction likelihood.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 has a focus count of 46, close to the threshold, and meets both the distance and time thresholds with a time of 1.46 seconds. This combination of factors suggests that it is a likely candidate for interaction.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: TvRemote_1 also has a high focus count of 45 and meets the distance and time thresholds with a time of 1.52 seconds, making it a strong contender for user interaction, albeit slightly less so than the first two.

    - Donut_B
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to engage with objects related to comfort or leisure, potentially involving snacks or media entertainment, as indicated by the focus on the Donut and remote controls.
