2024-10-17 11:25:57,440 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.45
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ConsoleTable
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus count (60) and a proximity count (38) indicating strong interest and close proximity within the defined threshold. Its short time to approach (0.899 seconds) suggests that the user is likely to interact with it soon.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon has a strong focus count (56) and a proximity count (36), alongside a short time to approach (0.888 seconds). These factors indicate that while it might not surpass the KitchenKnife in focus, it remains a close contender for interaction.
    - object: ConsoleTable
      reason: Although the ConsoleTable has a lower focus count (57) compared to the first two objects, it remains close in terms of proximity (16) and has a reasonable time to approach (0.926 seconds). This places it as a viable option, albeit less certain than the previous two.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - KitchenKnife
    - WoodenSpoon
    - ConsoleTable

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or engage in cooking activities, given the focus on kitchen-related tools.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ConsoleTable
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus consistency count of 60 and is in close proximity at 1.080 meters. It also has a low time to approach of approximately 0.9 seconds, making it the most likely object for interaction, especially if the user is engaging in a task that requires cutting or preparing food.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon has a focus consistency count of 56 and a proximity count of 36, indicating that the user is likely considering it for their task. Its distance of 1.135 meters and a quick approach time of about 0.9 seconds also suggest it is a probable candidate for interaction.
    - object: ConsoleTable
      reason: While the ConsoleTable has a lower focus count of 57, it is still in proximity at 1.729 meters. It may be a less immediate interaction compared to the other objects, but still likely as it can serve as a surface for placing items, further supporting the user's task.

    - KitchenKnife
    - WoodenSpoon
    - ConsoleTable

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food, as indicated by their focus on kitchen-related objects like the KitchenKnife and WoodenSpoon. The presence of the ConsoleTable suggests they may also be organizing ingredients or preparing a workspace for cooking.
