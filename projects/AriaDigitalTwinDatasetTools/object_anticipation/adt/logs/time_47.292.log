2024-10-17 11:23:10,871 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: BlackRoundTable
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Donut_B
      probability: 0.35
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackRoundTable
      reason: The BlackRoundTable has the highest focus consistency count of 30 and an excellent proximity consistency count of 8, which indicates that the user is likely considering it as a focal point for interaction. Additionally, it has the shortest estimated time to approach of 1.27 seconds, suggesting it is a readily accessible object.
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: The Donut_B has a significant focus consistency count of 29, showing that the user has been observing it closely. Its proximity count of 26 also indicates sustained interest. The estimated time to approach is reasonable at 1.24 seconds, reinforcing its likelihood for interaction.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 has a focus consistency count of 27, which is high but slightly lower than the previous two objects. Although it has less proximity consistency (8), the time to approach is reasonable at approximately 1.78 seconds. This indicates that while it may not be the primary target, it remains a considered option for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackRoundTable
    - Donut_B
    - DvdRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to engage in an activity in the Living Room, possibly involving a snack or meal setup (indicated by the focus on Donut_B) and media consumption or control (indicated by the presence of DvdRemote_1). The BlackRoundTable serves as a probable location for placing items related to these activities.
