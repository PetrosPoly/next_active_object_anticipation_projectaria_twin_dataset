    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.45
    - object: BlackKitchenChair_B
      probability: 0.35
    - object: GreenApple_A
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "This object has the highest count in the high focus objects list, indicating that the user has intensely observed it multiple times, which suggests a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: BlackKitchenChair_B
      reason: "This object also has a high focus count, and its presence in the nearby objects list indicates the user may be considering it as a seating option, making it likely to interact with it next."
    - object: GreenApple_A
      reason: "Though it has a lower count compared to the first two, it has significant presence in the nearby objects list, which suggests that the user may be interested in interacting with it."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CakeMocha_A
    - BlackKitchenChair_B
    - GreenApple_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or enjoy some food or beverage, as indicated by the intense observation of items related to consumption and seating arrangements within the living space.
