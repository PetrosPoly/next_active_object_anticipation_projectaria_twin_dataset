    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      probability: 0.45
    - object: HeatTrivet
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      reason: "This object received the highest focus count of 41, indicating significant attention from the user. It is likely that the user is considering interacting with the coffee can."
    - object: HeatTrivet
      reason: "With a high focus count of 44, the HeatTrivet has a substantial chance of interaction. The user may want to place a hot item on it or use it in conjunction with the coffee can."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "Although it has slightly lower focus counts (74), it registered a high nearby interaction duration. This suggests that the user has likely spent time near the bowl, making interaction possible for serving or preparing items."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
    - HeatTrivet
    - BlackCeramicBowl

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or serve a beverage, potentially involving coffee, as indicated by the focus on coffee-related objects and associated items like the HeatTrivet and bowl for serving purposes.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: HeatTrivet
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      reason: "This object has the highest count in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list at 41, indicating significant attention from the user. Being a coffee can, it's likely involved in a task related to preparing a drink or snack."
    - object: HeatTrivet
      reason: "The HeatTrivet has a high count of 44 in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts', suggesting the user is focused on it, possibly for placing a hot item on it after preparing food or drink."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "Although the BlackCeramicBowl has a count of 74 in the 'nearby_objects_measured_in_counts', its relatively lower count in focus (though still notable) suggests it's being considered for use, likely to hold ingredients or food."

    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      reason: "This object has the highest focus count (41) and is also present in the list of nearby objects measured in counts (91), indicating that the user is likely planning to interact with it, potentially to pour some coffee or clean up."
    - object: HeatTrivet
      reason: "With a focus count of 44 and also being a nearby object (91), the HeatTrivet shows a strong potential for interaction. The user may be considering placing a hot item on it or using it for serving food."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "Although it has a lower focus count (74 in nearby objects), it is still among the top observed. It suggests that the user could be planning to use it for serving or holding food items."

    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      reason: "This object has the highest focus count (41) and proximity count (91), indicating that the user has shown significant interest and spent a considerable amount of time near it."
    - object: HeatTrivet
      reason: "The HeatTrivet also has a high focus count (44) and proximity count (91), suggesting that it is another object that has captured the user's attention and is likely to be involved in whatever task they are undertaking."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "Although its focus count is lower (74) compared to the other two, it has a high proximity count and has appeared on the user's radar in previous interactions, making it a reasonable candidate for interaction."
