      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: RedClock
      reason: "The RedClock has the highest count in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list, indicating that the user observed it the longest, suggesting a strong intention to interact with it."
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: "The BlackBarStool_B has a high count in the 'nearby_objects_measured_in_counts' list, showing the user spent a significant amount of time near it, which implies potential interaction despite a lower focus count."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl appears in previous predictions multiple times, indicating consistent interest and potential interaction intentions in the context of the ongoing task."

      probability: 0.3
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: RedClock
      reason: "The RedClock has the highest focus count (48) and is also among the nearby objects (91). This indicates a strong likelihood that the user is interested in interacting with it."
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: "The BlackBarStool_B has a significant nearby count (36), suggesting the user has remained close to it, which might indicate a potential interaction."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl appeared in several previous predictions, indicating a consistent interest from the user in this object, making it a candidate for potential interaction."

    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.3
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: RedClock
      reason: "The RedClock has the highest count in both the high focus (48 counts) and nearby (91 counts) lists, indicating that the user has spent significant time observing it and was also in close proximity. This suggests a strong likelihood of intending to interact with it."
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: "The BlackBarStool_B has a notable count of 36 in the nearby objects list, suggesting the user has spent considerable time in its vicinity. Additionally, its presence in the environment may indicate a purpose-related intention if the user plans to sit down."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl is consistently mentioned in the previous predictions, indicating that it has been on the user's radar. Although its count is lower compared to others, the recurring nature of predictions suggests it remains relevant to the user's ongoing task."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - RedClock
    - BlackBarStool_B
    - BlackCeramicBowl

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to check the time, possibly prepare or serve something, or find a place to sit while engaging in an activity in the living room.

    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: "As the second most observed nearby object (36 counts), the BlackBarStool_B was likely the object the user moved near, suggesting that they may intend to interact with it or use it to sit."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has appeared in previous predictions showing that the user may have an ongoing interest in it, as it appears repeatedly along with objects that may relate to food preparation."

rationale:
    - object: RedClock
      reason: "The RedClock has the highest focus count (48) and is also highly observed while the user was nearby (91), indicating it is likely the object of interest."
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: "The BlackBarStool_B has a significant amount of proximity (36 counts) and is one of the nearby objects measured, suggesting it may be a candidate for interaction, possibly for sitting or placing items."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "While the BlackCeramicBowl was not in the high-focus object list, it has been included in previous predictions and has a substantial history of being observed, which maintains its relevance."

rationale:
    - object: RedClock
      reason: "The RedClock has the highest intensity of focus (48 counts) and is often observed, suggesting the user is likely checking the time or interacting with it in some way."
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: "The BlackBarStool_B has a substantial nearby count (36) indicating the user has been in close proximity for a notable amount of time, which raises its likelihood of interaction."
