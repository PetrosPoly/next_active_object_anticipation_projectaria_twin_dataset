    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.30
    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "This object has the highest count in the high focus objects list, indicating that the user observed it most intensively in the recent timeframe. Its frequent mention in previous predictions suggests it is likely part of the user's current task."
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard appears consistently in previous predictions and is crucial for food preparation tasks, aligning with the objects observed around it. It has a solid presence in focus and previous interactions."
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask, while having a slightly lower count than the BlackCeramicBowl, is still among the high focus objects. It could be part of a preparation or serving task that the user is engaged in currently."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - ChoppingBoard
    - Flask

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is preparing or serving food, considering their focus on kitchenware and food items.

    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.35

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has the highest focus count (83), indicating that it was observed intensively, suggesting a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: "Donut_B has a high focus count (91) and is likely a desirable option for the user, indicating significant attention towards it."
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask also has a notable focus count (73) and consistency of previous predictions indicates the user has shown interest in interacting with it."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - Donut_B
    - Flask

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or serve food, possibly involving the use of bowls and drinks, given the attention on food containers and consumables observed so far.

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has the highest focus count (83), indicating it was observed intensively for a significant portion of the time window. Its presence in previous predictions further reinforces its likelihood of interaction."
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: "The Donut_B is another object with a high focus count (91), suggesting that the user has shown considerable interest in it. It has appeared in prior predictions, indicating ongoing interaction interest."
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask has a focus count of 73 and has consistently appeared in previous predictions, indicating the user has related interactions with it, enhancing its probability of being interacted with."
