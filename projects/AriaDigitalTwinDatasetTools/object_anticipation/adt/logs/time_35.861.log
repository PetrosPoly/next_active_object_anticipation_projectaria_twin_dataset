2024-10-17 11:26:09,984 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: Mango_A has the highest focus count (87) and is within close proximity (1.023 meters) to the user, along with a favorable approach time (0.88 seconds). This combination of strong focus and proximity suggests that the user is very likely to interact with this object soon.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a high focus count (61) and is also very close to the user (1.258 meters), coupled with a reasonable approach time (1.12 seconds). While its focus is not the highest, its consistent proximity makes it a strong candidate for interaction.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: CakeMocha_A has a solid focus count (82) and a proximity count indicative of frequent observation (1.199 meters). Although it falls in the third position, the high focus still suggests that this object may be of interest, especially when added to the task at hand.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Mango_A
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - CakeMocha_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or serve food, possibly involving fruits (like the Mango_A) and some dessert (like CakeMocha_A), as indicated by the focus on food-related items while in the Living Room setting.
