    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.4
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 has the highest focus consistency (83 counts), is within the proximity threshold (1.715 meters), and the time to approach is under 2 seconds (approximately 1.97 seconds). This suggests that the user is very likely to interact with this object due to its high focus and suitable approach time.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: TvRemote_1 also has strong focus consistency (83 counts) and is within the distance threshold (1.757 meters), with a time to approach of about 2 seconds. The combined high focus and proximity indicate that the user is likely considering interacting with this object.
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      reason: ToothbrushHolder has a high focus consistency (80 counts) and is within proximity (1.724 meters) as well. The time to approach is about 1.76 seconds, which satisfies the threshold. While slightly lower in probability than the remotes, it still shows clear signs of user interest.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - ToothbrushHolder

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to engage with entertainment-related tasks, possibly watching media or interacting with devices related to relaxation and leisure in the living room setting.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 has the highest focus consistency with 83 counts and is within 1.715 meters (meeting the distance threshold). The time to approach is also below the 2-second threshold (1.966 seconds), making it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: TvRemote_1 shows the same focus consistency as DvdRemote_1 (83 counts) and is just a few millimeters further away, remaining within 1.757 meters. The time to approach is slightly longer (2.014 seconds) but still acceptable, indicating likely interaction.
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      reason: ToothbrushHolder has a commendable focus consistency of 80 counts and is at a comparable distance of 1.724 meters. However, its time to approach of 1.756 seconds is slightly better than the TvRemote_1, making it a probable candidate for interaction, albeit with slightly lower focus consistency.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - ToothbrushHolder

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to engage with entertainment system controls, likely to play content or adjust settings, while potentially contemplating a personal care activity given the proximity and focus on the ToothbrushHolder.

      probability: 0.45
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackRoundTable
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: The DvdRemote_1 has the highest focus consistency count (83) and a reasonable proximity count (15), as well as a quick time to approach (1.97 seconds), making it highly likely the user will interact with this object.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: The TvRemote_1 shares an equal focus consistency count (83) and slightly longer time to approach (2.01 seconds) but meets the distance threshold. Its consistent focus suggests a high likelihood of interaction.
    - object: BlackRoundTable
      reason: Although its focus consistency (69) is lower than that of the remotes, it has strong proximity consistency (15) and a relatively quick time to approach (1.65 seconds). This makes it probable for interaction, especially as the user is near this object.

    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - BlackRoundTable

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to control their media settings or watch a video, possibly while also considering utilizing nearby surfaces like the BlackRoundTable for additional items or snacks.
