    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.4
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "This object has the highest count of 62 in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list, indicating it received significant attention from the user, suggesting a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: "With a count of 46 in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts', this object is also among the most observed, showing a reasonable amount of user focus which hints that the user may want to interact with it next."
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: "This object has a notable presence in the 'nearby_objects_measured_in_counts' list with a count of 73, indicating that the user has spent a considerable amount of time near it, suggesting a prospective interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - WhiteUtensilTray
    - WoodenSpoon

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or serve food, likely involving making a drink or dish where they might need the coffee from the canister, utensils from the tray, and mixing or serving tools such as the wooden spoon.

      probability: 0.38
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.32
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.30

rationale:
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      reason: "Cracker_Anon has the highest count in the nearby_objects_measured_in_counts list (77), indicating the user spent considerable time close to this object, making it highly likely for interaction."
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: "WoodenSpoon has a significant count of 73 in nearby_objects_measured_in_counts, suggesting the user was near it for an extended period and may consider using it for food preparation."
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: "WhiteUtensilTray has a count of 59 in nearby_objects_measured_in_counts and 46 in high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts, indicating that it captured the user's attention and the user likely needs utensils for the task at hand."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Cracker_Anon
    - WoodenSpoon
    - WhiteUtensilTray

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or serve food, likely involving using utensils and snacks, as indicated by the interest in the snacks and utensils observed in both focus and proximity counts.
