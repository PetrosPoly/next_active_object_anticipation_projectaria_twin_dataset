    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.3
    - object: None
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus (48 counts) and proximity (48 counts), indicating strong user interest. Additionally, it is within a close distance (1.024 meters) and has a time to approach of only 3.63 seconds, satisfying all thresholds."
    - object: RedClock
      reason: "The RedClock meets the proximity threshold (48 counts) and has a significant focus count (17 counts), though it does not meet the focus threshold of 45 counts. However, it is very close (1.115 meters) and has a time to approach just above the threshold, making interaction likely."
    - object: None
      reason: "There are no other objects meeting a relevant threshold, hence probability is assigned to None reflecting the lack of other objects for interaction based on current data."

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare a beverage (possibly coffee or tea), as indicated by the strong focus and proximity to the coffee canister, along with the nearby clock that suggests the user may be mindful of time while preparing the drink.

    - object: None
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus and proximity counts, indicating that the user is highly attentive to it and is within close range, making it the most probable object for interaction."
    - object: RedClock
      reason: "RedClock ranks second with high proximity counts and a decent focus score, suggesting that while the user's focus may not be as intense, they are still likely to consider it for interaction due to being in close range."
    - object: None
      reason: "There are no other objects currently meeting any thresholds that would position them for interaction; hence a placeholder is kept with a smaller probability."

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing a drink or snack, as indicated by their strong focus on the CoffeeCanisterLarge, which is often associated with coffee or similar items.

      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus count (48) and is also within an acceptable distance range (1.024 meters), making it the most probable object for interaction."
    - object: RedClock
      reason: "The RedClock, while having a lower focus count (17), is still within a close distance (1.115 meters) and satisfies the proximity counts, suggesting it may attract the user's attention despite the lower focus."
    - object: None
      reason: "There are no other objects listed that meet the criteria; hence, this category serves as a filler representing the absence of a third object."

    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the predictions and context, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely focused on preparing or obtaining a beverage, considering the high interaction probability with the CoffeeCanisterLarge, which suggests they might be looking to use coffee or related items in the living room.

    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object satisfied both distance (1.024 meters) and time thresholds (3.63 seconds), while also having a high focus count (48). The proximity counts match the user's predicted intentions, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: While the RedClock has a strong proximity consistency (48 counts) and adequate focus (17 counts), it does not meet the time threshold requirement (11.25 seconds). However, given its consistent attention, it is still considered the next likely object for interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: Since no additional objects showed potential for interaction based on the criteria, the prediction of "None" emphasizes the focus on the first two objects as the most likely candidates.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to retrieve or use the contents of the CoffeeCanisterLarge for a task, possibly involving making a beverage, while keeping track of time with the RedClock.

      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has the highest focus consistency count (48), is within a close distance (1.024 meters), and meets the time threshold for approaching (3.625 seconds). These factors suggest that the user is highly likely to interact with the CoffeeCanisterLarge soon.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a solid focus consistency (17 counts) and a close proximity (1.115 meters), but it does not meet the time threshold for approaching as effectively as the CoffeeCanisterLarge. It remains a likely object due to its proximity and some degree of attention from the user.
    - object: None
      reason: No other objects meet any of the criteria strongly enough to be considered for interaction outside the two identified. Thus, the probability for a third object is minimal.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare a beverage or snack in the living room, which requires accessing the CoffeeCanisterLarge while possibly checking the time on the RedClock.

    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has a high focus count (48) and distance is within a close range (1.024 meters), satisfying the focus and proximity thresholds. The approaching time of 3.63 seconds is also below the threshold of 4 seconds, making it the object the user is most likely to interact with.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a considerable focus count (17) and is also close in proximity (1.115 meters) but does not meet the time threshold (11.25 seconds). It satisfies the distance threshold but falls short on focus, making it likely but less probable than the CoffeeCanisterLarge.
    - object: None
      reason: While the other objects do not meet significant criteria, this category accounts for potential future consideration if the userâ€™s focus or proximity changes, or if new objects come into play.

    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions, it is inferred that the user is likely trying to prepare or consume coffee in the living room, as indicated by the high focus on the CoffeeCanisterLarge and proximity to the RedClock, possibly to check the time before starting their preparation.

    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.3
    - object: None
      probability: 0.1

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus count (48), meets proximity and time thresholds, making it the most likely object the user will interact with. Its close distance (1.024 meters) and comparatively low time to approach (3.63 seconds) further support this likelihood.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although the RedClock also has significant proximity counts and a close distance (1.115 meters), its focus count (17) is lower than that of the CoffeeCanisterLarge. As a result, it is less likely but still probable for interaction, especially since it meets the distance and time thresholds.
    - object: None
      reason: No other objects are present in this scenario that meet any interaction thresholds, making the probability for another object negligible.
