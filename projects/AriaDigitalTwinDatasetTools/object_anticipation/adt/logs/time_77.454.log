2024-10-17 11:13:10,763 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.4
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has the highest focus consistency at 65 counts and a proximity consistency of 10 counts, making it a top candidate for interaction. The approach time of just over 2 seconds suggests the user is very close to interacting with it.
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge is very close to the user with a distance of 1.803 meters and a similar approach time of approximately 1.84 seconds. It also has a significant focus count of 57, signaling potential intent to engage with it.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The WhiteUtensilTray also shows a good focus count of 45 and is relatively close with a distance of 1.782 meters. Its proximity and focus metrics suggest it might be next in line for interaction, although with slightly less certainty than the first two objects.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - RedClock
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - WhiteUtensilTray

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to utilize kitchen-related objects in the living room, possibly for preparing a drink or snack, as indicated by the frequent attention to the CoffeeCanisterLarge and the presence of a clock indicating time management in their task.
