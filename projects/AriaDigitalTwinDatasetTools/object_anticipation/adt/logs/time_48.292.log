    - object: BlackRoundTable
      probability: 0.4
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackRoundTable
      reason: The BlackRoundTable has the highest focus count (60) and a reasonable proximity count (38) while also having a short time to approach (0.64 seconds). This combination makes it the most likely object for the user to interact with at this moment.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: The DvdRemote_1 has a strong focus count (57) and satisfying proximity (38), along with a short time to approach (1.39 seconds). It meets the distance and focus criteria satisfactorily, placing it as the second most probable object for interaction.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: The TvRemote_1 also shows high focus (56), reasonable proximity (36), and an approach time of 1.49 seconds. While slightly less probable than the first two objects, it still fits within the criteria that suggest the user will likely interact with it.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackRoundTable
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to engage with items on the BlackRoundTable, possibly selecting a remote control (DvdRemote_1 or TvRemote_1) to operate a media device or entertainment system in the living room.

    - object: Donut_B
      probability: 0.45
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has the highest focus count (59) and is also the closest object at a distance of 0.955 meters, with an approach time of only 0.57 seconds. This indicates a strong likelihood of interaction.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 meets both the distance (1.223 meters) and time (1.39 seconds) thresholds, with a solid focus count (57). Its proximity and relatively quick approach time make it very likely for the user to interact with it next.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: TvRemote_1 has a focus count of 56, is within an acceptable distance (1.261 meters), and has a reasonable approach time (1.49 seconds). While slightly lower in focus compared to the top two objects, it still presents a strong possibility of interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Donut_B
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to using the remotes for viewing something (potentially watching TV) and enjoying a treat, as indicated by the focused attention on food items like the Donut_B and electronic items such as remotes.

      probability: 0.35
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackRoundTable
      reason: The BlackRoundTable has the highest focus count (60) and is within close proximity (1.457 meters) with a quick approach time (about 0.64 seconds), making it the most likely object for interaction.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: The DvdRemote_1 has a strong focus count (57) and is relatively close (1.223 meters) with a reasonable approach time (1.39 seconds), indicating a high likelihood of use, especially in a living room context.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: The TvRemote_1 has a focus count of 56 and a distance of 1.261 meters, along with an approachable time of 1.49 seconds, confirming its likelihood of being interacted with, particularly for activities typically conducted within a living room.
