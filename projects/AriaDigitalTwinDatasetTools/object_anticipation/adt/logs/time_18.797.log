      reason: "The KitchenKnife has the highest focus consistency count (55), is within a reasonable proximity (1.192 meters), and requires a short approach time (approximately 0.99 seconds). These factors make it highly probable that the user intends to interact with it."
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: "The WoodenSpoon also has a strong focus consistency count (51), is close in proximity (1.258 meters), and has a quick approach time (about 1.05 seconds). This combination indicates a strong likelihood of interaction following the KitchenKnife."
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      reason: "While the AirPurifier_1 has a lower focus count (45), it is within a close range (1.462 meters) and has a reasonable approach time (1.37 seconds). Although it does not meet the high threshold of focus, its proximity suggests potential interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - KitchenKnife
    - WoodenSpoon
    - AirPurifier_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food or performing tasks in the kitchen area, given the high focus on kitchen utensils and tools.
2024-10-15 12:06:49,988 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ConsoleTable
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: "The KitchenKnife has the highest focus count (55) and proximity count (33), along with a very low distance of 1.192 meters and a quick approach time of 0.994 seconds, making it the most likely object for the user to interact with."
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: "The WoodenSpoon has a high focus count (51) and a reasonable proximity count (31), as well as a close distance of 1.258 meters and an approach time of 1.046 seconds. These factors point towards it being a highly probable object for interaction."
    - object: ConsoleTable
      reason: "While the ConsoleTable has a slightly lower focus count (52) and proximity count (11), it still remains a viable option due to its proximity and focus consistency, albeit at a greater distance (1.823 meters) and a longer approach time (1.077 seconds)."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - KitchenKnife
    - WoodenSpoon
    - ConsoleTable

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or engage in a cooking-related task, as indicated by their focus on kitchen-related items like the KitchenKnife and WoodenSpoon.
