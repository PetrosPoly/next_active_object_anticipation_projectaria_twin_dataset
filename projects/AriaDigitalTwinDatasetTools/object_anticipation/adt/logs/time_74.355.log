    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: BlackKitchenChair_B
      reason: "It has the highest count in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list, indicating the user has observed it with intense focus, suggesting a strong intention to interact."
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "This item is also among the top in focus counts and is likely relevant to the user's activities, possibly related to a meal or snack preparation."
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      reason: "Although lower in focus counts, it has a significant presence in the 'nearby_objects_measured_in_counts' list, indicating that the user has spent time near it, which may lead to interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackKitchenChair_B
    - CakeMocha_A
    - BirdHouseToy

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to either prepare or serve food (implied by the presence of the CakeMocha_A) and to possibly utilize the BlackKitchenChair_B for sitting or placing items nearby, while the BirdHouseToy might be a playful or emotional interaction as part of a broader context in the living space.

    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "With a considerable count of 30, this object has caught the user's attention enough to be a potential interaction, likely for getting a drink."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackKitchenChair_B
    - CakeMocha_A
