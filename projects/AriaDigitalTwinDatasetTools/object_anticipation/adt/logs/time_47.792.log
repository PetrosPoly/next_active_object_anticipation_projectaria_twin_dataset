2024-10-17 11:27:25,955 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: Donut_B
      probability: 0.4
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has the highest focus count of 44, which exceeds the threshold of 45, and a distance of 1.193 meters, which is well within the acceptable range. The time to approach is also relatively short at approximately 0.88 seconds, indicating that the user is likely to interact with it soon.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 has a close focus count of 42 and a distance of 1.513 meters. While it does not meet the focus threshold, it is in close proximity and has a short approach time of about 1.47 seconds. This positions it as a strong candidate for interaction.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: TvRemote_1 has a focus count of 41, just shy of the threshold. Its distance of 1.554 meters and approach time of approximately 1.53 seconds also suggest that the user is likely to engage with it soon, especially considering the high focus count.
