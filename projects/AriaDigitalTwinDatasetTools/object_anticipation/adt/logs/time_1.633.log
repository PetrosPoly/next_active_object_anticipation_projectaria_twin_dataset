      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.10

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "It has the highest focus (50 counts) and proximity consistency (50 counts), and the time to approach (2.86 seconds) is below the threshold, making it the most likely object for interaction."
    - object: RedClock
      reason: "While it meets the distance (1.1 meters) and proximity thresholds, its focus count (17 counts) is lower, but the user is close enough to potentially interact with it, hence it's the second most likely."
    - object: None
      reason: "No other objects meet the criteria that could be predicted as probable interactions, hence this is assigned a lower probability."

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to interact with objects in the living room that support their need for either time management (observing the RedClock) or accessing a coffee supply (CoffeeCanisterLarge).

    - object: None
      probability: 0.0

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "The user has high focus consistency (50 counts) and is within an ideal proximity (1.015 meters) with a fast estimated time to approach (2.86 seconds), making it the most probable object for interaction."
    - object: RedClock
      reason: "While the RedClock meets the proximity (1.108 meters) and focus criteria (17 counts), the time to approach exceeds the threshold (7.27 seconds), giving it a lower probability compared to the CoffeeCanisterLarge."

    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or serve a drink, as they are focusing on the CoffeeCanisterLarge, which likely contains coffee or relevant supplies. The RedClock may play a role in timing or scheduling related to this activity.

    - object: None
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "This object has the highest focus and proximity counts, indicating the user has consistently observed and remained close to it, justifying a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: RedClock
      reason: "Although the RedClock has lower focus counts, it still meets the distance threshold and has notable proximity counts, suggesting the user may interact with it despite lower focus."
    - object: None
      reason: "Since there are no other objects meeting any criteria adequately based on the given context, this entry reflects that other objects are unlikely to be interacted with at this time."

      probability: 0.30
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus and proximity counts, indicating a sustained interest from the user. Additionally, it meets the time threshold for approaching, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has good focus counts, but its approach time is slightly longer. Although it doesn't meet the time threshold as strictly as the CoffeeCanisterLarge, its substantial focus on it suggests it is still a likely candidate for interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: No other object meets the attention or interaction criteria; hence this reflects a lower interest level or lack of viable alternatives for interaction.

      probability: 0.55
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus (50 counts) and proximity (50 counts) consistency from the user, indicating that it is a key object they are likely to interact with. Additionally, it has a short time to approach (2.86 seconds), which is under the 3-second threshold, making it the most probable choice.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a decent focus (17 counts) and proximity (50 counts) consistency. While its focus counts are lower, it meets the distance and time thresholds indicating that while it may not be the primary object of focus, the user is still likely to consider it for interaction given its proximity and the reasonable time to approach (7.27 seconds).
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other objects meeting the necessary cumulative thresholds for prediction, so this slot recognizes that the user may not currently have a third object for interaction in mind.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to retrieve or utilize coffee, involving interaction primarily with the CoffeeCanisterLarge, while also keeping an eye on the time (RedClock) to manage their activities effectively.

    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge satisfies the distance (1.015 meters) and the time (2.86 seconds) thresholds, making it highly probable for interaction. With the highest focus count (50 counts), it shows that the user has observed this object significantly, which enhances its likelihood of being selected for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock meets the proximity threshold (1.108 meters) and has a considerable focus count (17 counts). However, it fails to meet the time threshold but remains relevant due to consistent proximity and some focus, thereby being deemed the second most likely object.
    - object: None
      reason: As there are no other objects in the environment that meet the defined thresholds, this option is included to ensure the total probability adds up to 1.

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus count (50) as well as a strong proximity count (50), and it is also within close distance (1.015 meters). The time to approach is well within the threshold (2.86 seconds), making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock shows significant focus consistency (17 counts) and proximity consistency (50 counts), alongside a distance of 1.108 meters. Though it does not meet the focus threshold fully, it is still likely given the proximity and shorter distance.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no additional objects that meet the initial criteria sufficiently. Thus, we include a placeholder with a low probability to represent the absence of more likely candidates.

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has a high focus consistency count of 50, is at a close distance (1.015 meters), and has a short time to approach (2.86 seconds), clearly exceeding the thresholds for focus and time. The high proximity suggests it's a likely target for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has significant proximity and focus counts (17 for focus and 50 for proximity), but its time to approach (7.27 seconds) exceeds the threshold. Nonetheless, the combination of proximity and focus suggests it remains a probable target, though less likely than the CoffeeCanisterLarge.
