    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.4
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: "The KitchenKnife has the highest focus count (73), is within a close distance (1.205 meters), and requires a moderate time to approach (40.98 seconds). Its high focus and regular proximity counts suggest the user is likely intending to interact with it."
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard also has a high focus count (73), is at a similar distance (1.217 meters), and a longer approach time. The consistency in both focus and proximity suggests that it is a significant object for the user's intended task, likely related to food preparation."
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "While the CoffeeCanisterLarge has lower focus counts (25), it is the closest object (0.995 meters) and has a short approach time (1.56 seconds). This combination of proximity and time makes it probable for interaction, despite not having as high focus as the other two objects."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - KitchenKnife
    - ChoppingBoard
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to food preparation, utilizing both the KitchenKnife and ChoppingBoard for cutting or preparing ingredients, potentially involving the CoffeeCanisterLarge for accessing coffee or related items.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: "The KitchenKnife has the highest focus consistency count (73) and is within close proximity (1.205 meters), with a reasonable time to approach (40.98 seconds). It meets both the focus and proximity criteria, making it highly probable for interaction."
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard also has a high focus count (73) and is very close (1.217 meters), with a substantial time to approach (34.93 seconds). This indicates that the user frequently observes it and is likely to interact with it soon."
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan shows a good focus count (65) but has a longer distance (1.491 meters) and time to approach (10.78 seconds). While it meets the focus threshold, it falls slightly on the time aspect, making it less likely than the first two, but still probable."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - KitchenKnife
    - ChoppingBoard
    - MuffinPan

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food, possibly involving chopping or cooking, given the emphasis on kitchen tools like the Knife and ChoppingBoard.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: "The KitchenKnife has high focus (73 counts) and proximity consistency (91 counts) combined with a reasonable approach time (40.98 seconds). It is likely that the user intends to prepare food, hence the high focus and proximity suggest it is a priority."
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard also has high focus (73 counts) and proximity consistency (91 counts), along with a moderate approach time (34.93 seconds). This aligns well with food preparation tasks, indicating it is likely to be used after the KitchenKnife."
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan shows significant focus (65 counts) and proximity (91 counts), although the approach time is longer (10.78 seconds). Given that it relates to food preparation or baking, it is still a probable item for the user to interact with, especially if they are checking for bakeware after using the knife and board."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - KitchenKnife
    - ChoppingBoard
    - MuffinPan

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare food, likely involving chopping or slicing ingredients followed by the use of bakeware, indicating a cooking or baking session is intended.
