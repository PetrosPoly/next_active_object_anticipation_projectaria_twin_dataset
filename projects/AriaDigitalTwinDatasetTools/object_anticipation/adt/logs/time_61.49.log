    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.45
    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask has the highest focus count (53) and a significant nearby count (91), indicating that the user has observed it intensively and remained in its proximity for a considerable amount of time, suggesting a strong intent to interact."
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "Tomato_A follows closely with a high focus count (47) and a decent nearby count (59). Its presence in both focus and proximity suggests the user is considering it for interaction, likely related to preparation or cooking."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has a high nearby count (82), indicating that the user has spent a substantial amount of time near it. Although its focus count is lower than those of the Flask and Tomato_A, the proximity suggests it could be relevant to the user's current task."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Flask
    - Tomato_A
    - BlackCeramicBowl

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is likely to prepare or serve a dish, potentially involving ingredients like tomatoes and using the flask for liquids, along with the bowl for mixing or serving.

    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask had the highest count (53) in the high focus list, indicating that the user likely observed it the most attentively in the last few seconds."
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "The Tomato_A is the second highest in focus counts (47) and also has considerable nearby counts, implying that it was both observed closely and the user spent a fair amount of time near it."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "Though not the highest in focus counts (45), the BlackCeramicBowl has the highest nearby counts (82), suggesting that while it may not have drawn the user's intense focus, it was still noteworthy enough to be close to."

    - Flask
    - Tomato_A
    - BlackCeramicBowl

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or serve food or drinks, possibly involving ingredients such as tomatoes and using cooking utensils like the flask.

    - object: Tomato_A

    - object: WhiteVaseSmall_2
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask has the highest focus count (53) indicating it was observed most intensively, suggesting the user is likely to interact with it."
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "The Tomato_A has a high focus count (47) and is also present in the nearby objects, reflecting sustained interest and likelihood of interaction."
    - object: WhiteVaseSmall_2
      reason: "With a count of 45, the WhiteVaseSmall_2 was also observed closely, making it a potential candidate for interaction despite having a slightly lower count than the other two."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Flask
    - Tomato_A
    - WhiteVaseSmall_2

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is likely focused on preparing or serving food or drinks, as indicated by their interest in items such as the Flask and Tomato_A, which may be related to cooking or food presentation. The presence of kitchen-related items supports this inference.
