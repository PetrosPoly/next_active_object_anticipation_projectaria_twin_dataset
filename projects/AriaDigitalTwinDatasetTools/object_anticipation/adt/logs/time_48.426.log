    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.4
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Donut_B
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 has one of the highest counts for both focus (61) and proximity (42), and its time to approach is well within the acceptable threshold at 1.549 seconds. This indicates that the user is likely to interact with it soon.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: TvRemote_1 is very close in counts for focus (60) and proximity (40). Its time to approach, 1.668 seconds, is also below the threshold, making it another strong candidate for interaction.
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B shows a high focus count (63) and proximity count (60), and it has the shortest time to approach at 0.518 seconds. While it may not meet a specific distance threshold since it is slightly further than DvdRemote_1 and TvRemote_1 in terms of being located on the coffee table, its high focus and proximity suggest it may soon be interacted with.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - Donut_B

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to engage with the media setup in the living room, likely involving watching a movie or show, which would require the use of the remote controls. The presence of Donut_B suggests the user may also be planning to have a snack while engaging with the media.

    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has a high focus count of 63 and is very close to the user at a distance of 0.873 meters. Its time to approach is also very low at 0.518 seconds, indicating the user is likely preparing to interact with it.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: The DvdRemote_1 has a significant focus count of 61 and is relatively close at 1.133 meters. While it does not meet the time threshold of 2 seconds, the combination of focus and proximity suggests that the user has strong intent to interact with it.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: Similar to the DvdRemote_1, the TvRemote_1 also has a high focus count of 60 and is in close proximity at 1.171 meters. Though it fails to meet the time threshold, its focus and distance counts suggest itâ€™s still a potential interaction target.

    - TvRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to enjoying a snack or a drink while potentially watching something on TV, as evidenced by the strong focus on remote controls and the food item.

    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has the highest counts for both focus (63) and proximity (60), indicating the user has been closely observing and is also very close to the object. Its quick approach time (0.52 seconds) further reinforces its likelihood of interaction.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 meets the distance and time thresholds while also showing a strong focus consistency (61). Although it doesn't exceed the focus count threshold significantly, its proximity shows the user is likely to consider interacting with it imminently.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: Similar to DvdRemote_1, TvRemote_1 shows strong proximity consistency (40) and focus counts (60), meeting the criteria of both distance and partial focus. Its approach time (1.67 seconds) also suggests it could be interacted with soon.

    - TvRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to relaxing or consuming a treat in the living room, possibly while enjoying media, indicated by the focus on both food items and remote controls for electronics.

    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has high focus consistency counts (63) and is within a close distance (0.873 meters) with a short time to approach (0.518 seconds). This meets all thresholds, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 shows considerable focus (61 counts) and is within a reasonable distance (1.133 meters). Although the time to approach is slightly longer (1.55 seconds), it still meets the distance and focus thresholds, suggesting it is likely to be interacted with soon.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: TvRemote_1 also has a strong focus consistency (60 counts) and is relatively close (1.171 meters). Like DvdRemote_1, it does not meet the time threshold but still satisfies both focus and distance thresholds, making it a probable object for interaction.

    - TvRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely centered around enjoying leisure time in the living room, potentially watching something while snacking, which aligns with the interaction possibilities with food (Donut_B) and remote controls (DvdRemote_1, TvRemote_1).
