      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: "The WoodenFork has the highest focus count (89) and is within close proximity (1.117 meters), with a reasonable approach time (6.22 seconds). This indicates that the user is likely to interact with it soon."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl shows a high focus count (73) and is in close proximity (1.206 meters). It also has a quick approach time (2.55 seconds), suggesting the user is considering it for interaction."
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: "The CandleDishSmall has an adequate focus count (34) and proximity (1.384 meters), along with a faster approach time (1.7 seconds). While not the most focused on, its proximity and quicker approach time still make it a viable option for interaction."

    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: "The WoodenFork has high focus counts (89) and a proximity count of 91, with a time to approach of 6.22 seconds. Although it doesn't meet the time threshold, it satisfies both focus and distance thresholds, making it a probable candidate for interaction."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has a strong focus count (73), proximity count (91), and a time to approach that is well within the threshold at 2.55 seconds. This fulfills the criteria of both focus and distance, rendering it highly likely for interaction."
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "Although CakeMocha_A has a lower focus count (88), it has satisfactory proximity (91). However, with a longer time to approach (14.13 seconds), it just meets the distance requirement. Therefore, it is still a viable option but has a lower probability than the other two."

    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "CakeMocha_A has a good focus count of 88, but its distance and time to approach are slightly less favorable compared to the first two, though it remains a probable candidate for interaction."

      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: "WoodenFork meets the focus and distance thresholds (89 counts and 1.117m), and the time to approach is within the acceptable range (6.22 seconds). Its high focus consistency indicates strong intent to interact."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "BlackCeramicBowl satisfies the focus (73 counts) and proximity (91 counts) thresholds, with a distance of 1.206m, making it likely that the user will interact with it soon, despite a slightly longer approach time (2.55 seconds)."
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "CakeMocha_A has a solid focus count (88) and is within proximity (1.379m), but with a longer approach time (14.13 seconds) which makes it less likely than the first two objects, though still a probable candidate given the user's visible interest."

rationale:
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: "The WoodenFork has the highest focus (89 counts) and time to approach (6.22 seconds) within acceptable limits, making it a highly probable object for interaction. Its proximity consistency (91 counts) also suggests the user has been in close range."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has a high focus count (73 counts) and a very close distance to the user (1.206 meters), along with reasonable time to approach (2.55 seconds). Given its significant attention measures, it is likely to be a target for interaction."
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "The CakeMocha_A has a good focus count (88 counts) indicating significant user interest, along with a proximity count of 91. Although the time to approach (14.13 seconds) is higher, the focus and distance metrics suggest it is still a possible object of interaction."

      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: "The WoodenFork has the highest counts in focus (89) and a reasonable distance (1.117 meters) that satisfies both focus and proximity. It also has a time to approach under the threshold (6.22 seconds), making it highly probable for interaction."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl shows consistent focus (73 counts) and is also within proximity (1.206 meters). The time to approach is low (2.55 seconds), fulfilling the distance and time criteria, thus making it likely for the user to interact with it."
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "While CakeMocha_A has slightly lower focus counts (88) but remains within a suitable distance (1.379 meters), it has a longer time to approach (14.13 seconds), which is over the threshold. However, the good focus and proximity make it a probable choice for interaction."
