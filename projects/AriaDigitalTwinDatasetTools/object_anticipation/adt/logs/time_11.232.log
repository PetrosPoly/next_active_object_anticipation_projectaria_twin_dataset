    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug had 38 counts in the high_focus_objects list and a decent count in the nearby_objects list (38), suggesting a moderate likelihood of interaction due to the user's sustained attention."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Jam_Anon
    - MuffinPan
    - BlackCeramicMug

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or consume food, possibly involving the use of the jam, muffin pan, and mug for a snack or meal preparation.

    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "The user has the highest focus count (44) on Jam_Anon, indicating significant attention and likely intent to interact with this object."
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "With a focus count of 42, the MuffinPan has garnered considerable attention and may suggest intentions related to food preparation, fitting within the context."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug also has a significant focus count (38) and is a commonly interacted object for beverages, which might align with the user's current activities."

    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.4
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "The user has observed the Jam_Anon intensely with the highest count of 44, indicating a strong intention to interact with it. Additionally, its relevance to food preparation suggests it is likely critical for the user's task."
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan has a high focus count of 42, which implies significant attention from the user. Given that the presence of a jam may indicate baking or preparation, the MuffinPan is likely needed in conjunction with the jam."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "With a count of 38, the BlackCeramicMug has also garnered considerable attention, possibly indicating that the user may want to use it for consuming a beverage that goes along with the jam or muffins."

    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.4
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: Jam_Anon has a high focus consistency count (44) and is within a reasonable distance (1.905 meters) for interaction. This indicates that the user is likely preparing to use it, possibly for spreading on food or incorporating it into a recipe.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: MuffinPan has the highest focus count (42) among the probable objects and is also within close proximity (1.568 meters). This suggests that the user may be planning to bake or prepare muffins, indicating intent to interact soon.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: BlackCeramicMug has a strong focus count (37) but is slightly less likely to be interacted with immediately due to its distance (1.718 meters). However, the high focus suggests it remains a potential candidate for interaction, possibly for drink preparation or serving.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Jam_Anon
    - MuffinPan
    - BlackCeramicMug

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare a meal or snack, potentially involving the use of jam, baking muffins, and serving a drink, indicating a sequence towards food preparation.

    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.4
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Mortar
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: Jam_Anon has the highest focus count (44) and is within a reasonable distance (1.905 meters) with an approach time of 2.898 seconds. Although it slightly exceeds the threshold for time to approach, the high focus count indicates significant attention from the user, making it the most probable choice.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: MuffinPan also displays a strong focus count (42) and a distance of 1.568 meters, with a time to approach of 2.254 seconds. This combination satisfies both the focus and proximity criteria, giving it a high probability of interaction.
    - object: Mortar
      reason: Mortar has a focus count of 44, which satisfies the focus threshold quite well and a proximity count that suggests reduced time spent (1.691 meters with 2.548 seconds to approach). While it doesnâ€™t meet the time threshold perfectly, the focus count supports its predictability for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Jam_Anon
    - MuffinPan
    - Mortar

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or making a dish involving jam and potentially muffins, suggesting a cooking or baking activity.
