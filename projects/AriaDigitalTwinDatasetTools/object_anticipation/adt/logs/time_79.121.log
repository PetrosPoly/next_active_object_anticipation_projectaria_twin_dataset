    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has the highest focus consistency count of 81 and is the closest to the user at 1.054 meters, along with a relatively short approach time of 2.36 seconds. It satisfies all thresholds, making it the most likely object of interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug has a high focus consistency count of 82 and is located 1.414 meters away from the user. Although it did not fully meet the time threshold (3.47 seconds), its strong focus and proximity suggest a probable intention to interact with it.
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork has a decent focus consistency count of 80 and a proximity distance of 1.945 meters. Even though it does not fully satisfy the time threshold (4.91 seconds), it meets the focus threshold, making it a less likely but still probable object for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - WoodenFork

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare or consume a beverage, likely involving retrieving coffee and possibly utilizing the BlackCeramicMug for serving. The interaction with the WoodenFork suggests some preparatory aspect, possibly involving food items that might accompany the beverage.

    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge meets the distance threshold (1.054 meters) and the time threshold (2.36 seconds to approach) while having a high focus count (81). This combination makes it the most likely object for interaction, especially if the user is preparing a drink or food.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug is also within the proximity threshold (1.414 meters) and has a suitable time to approach (3.47 seconds). It has a high focus count (82), suggesting the user has been observing it closely, likely indicating intent to use it for drinking.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: While the ChoppingBoard is slightly further away (1.418 meters) and has a time to approach of 6.65 seconds, it still meets the distance threshold and has a strong focus count (58). This implies that despite the longer approach time, it remains a probable object for interaction, possibly for food preparation.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - ChoppingBoard

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food or a beverage, as the objects in focus are commonly associated with such tasks. The close attention to the CoffeeCanisterLarge and BlackCeramicMug suggests that the user may be in the process of making coffee or tea.

    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The WhiteUtensilTray has the highest focus count (89), and a proximity count of (59), both of which meet the thresholds, making it highly probable for interaction. Its short time to approach (1.15 seconds) suggests quick access.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug has a strong focus count (82), proximity count (38), and a reasonable time to approach (3.47 seconds), making it a probable next choice. While it does not meet the time threshold, its focus indicates significant interest.
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge features a high focus count (81) and meets both the distance and time thresholds, resulting in a solid likelihood for interaction. Even though the focus count is slightly lower than the top two choices, its quick access time bolsters its probability.

    - WhiteUtensilTray
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food or drinks, as the objects being focused on are kitchenware and utensils typically used in food preparation or serving.

    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: This object has a high focus consistency count of 89, is within a close proximity of 0.98 meters from the user, and has a low approach time of approximately 1.15 seconds, indicating that the user is likely to interact with it soon.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug also shows significant focus with a count of 82, is relatively close at 1.41 meters, and has an approach time of 3.47 seconds. This suggests it is a strong candidate for interaction, though slightly less probable than the WhiteUtensilTray.
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: With 81 focus counts and being the closest object at 1.054 meters with an approach time of approximately 2.36 seconds, the CoffeeCanisterLarge is likely involved in the user's task, though it ranks lower in probability compared to the first two objects.
