    - object: CandleDishSmall
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: The CandleDishSmall shows strong focus counts (73), high proximity counts (15), and a reasonable time to approach (approximately 2 seconds), making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a strong focus count (67) and meets the proximity threshold (13 counts), along with a quick approach time (about 1.89 seconds), positioning it as the second most likely interaction target.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: CakeMocha_A is close to satisfying all thresholds, with a focus count of 64, a proximity count of 2 (just below the ideal level), and an approach time of roughly 2.29 seconds, making it plausible for interaction despite not meeting the time threshold.

    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: This object has a high focus count (73) and is also within the proximity threshold with a reasonable distance (1.684m and 1.979s to approach), making it a strong candidate for interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a good focus count (67) and proximity count (13), and although the time to approach slightly exceeds the threshold, its combination of focus and distance makes it likely.
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: While this object has a focus count (67) that meets the focus threshold and is a close distance (1.689m) with a time to approach that marginally overlaps, its proximity consistency further suggests potential interaction.

    - BlackCeramicDishSmall

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past predictions, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to arrange or set up items in the living room, possibly for decoration or preparation for an event, utilizing the objects that have been consistently focused on and are in proximity.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: It has high focus counts (73) and satisfies the proximity threshold very well with a consistent count of 15. Additionally, its approach time of approximately 2 seconds makes it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl shows considerable focus counts (67) and proximity consistency with a count of 13. Although it does not meet the time threshold perfectly, the high focus suggests that the user is paying attention to it.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A has a focus count of 63, meets the distance threshold, and has a reasonable approach time of about 2.08 seconds, making it a probable candidate for user interaction.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: This object has the highest counts in both the focus (73) and proximity (15) metrics, indicating that the user is paying significant attention to it while being physically close, which supports a likely interaction. Additionally, the time to approach (1.979 seconds) is within the acceptable range.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The focus count for the BlackCeramicBowl is 67, which is substantial, and its proximity count also indicates that the user has been near it (13 counts), though the time to approach is slightly longer (1.886 seconds). It shows strong potential for interaction based on these metrics.
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: With a focus count of 67 and proximity counts of 13, this object is also a strong candidate for interaction. The time to approach (1.884 seconds) makes it a probable choice, though it ranks lower than the first two due to comparatively less attention focused on it.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare or serve items, possibly related to some form of food or decor, given the context of the objects that gather great focus and proximity.
