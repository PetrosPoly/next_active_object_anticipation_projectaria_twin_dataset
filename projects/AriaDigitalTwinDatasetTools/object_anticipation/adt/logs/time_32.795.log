rationale:
    - object: WoodenBowl
      reason: The WoodenBowl has the highest focus count (52) and is within an acceptable distance (1.386 meters) with a low approach time (1.377 seconds). This suggests the user is likely considering interacting with it soon.
    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      reason: The NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon has a strong proximity count (30) and focus count (47), and it is close enough (1.384 meters) with a reasonable approach time (1.429 seconds). This indicates potential interaction, especially as the user has shown consistent interest.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: The CakeMocha_A has good focus (49 counts) and proximity (16 counts) but is slightly farther away (1.625 meters) with a longer approach time (1.743 seconds). Although it doesn't meet the time threshold, the user’s consistent focus on it indicates potential interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WoodenBowl
    - NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
    - CakeMocha_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or consume a beverage or snack, possibly involving the use of the WoodenBowl for serving and the NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon for coffee preparation or consumption, with the CakeMocha_A as a potential treat to accompany their drink.
