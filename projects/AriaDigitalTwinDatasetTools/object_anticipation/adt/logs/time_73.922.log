    - object: GreySofa
      probability: 0.37
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.33
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      probability: 0.30

rationale:
    - object: GreySofa
      reason: "The GreySofa has a high focus count of 62, indicating it has received significant attention from the user. It is likely the user intends to sit down or interact with it."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 has a focus count of 59 and is also present in the user's nearby objects list with a high count. This implies a likelihood of the user needing it for operation, potentially in conjunction with the GreySofa."
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      reason: "The BirdHouseToy has a focus count of 62, showing that it also attracted the user's attention. Given the living room context, it might be of interest for interaction or play."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - GreySofa
    - DvdRemote_1
    - BirdHouseToy

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is to relax or engage with media entertainment in the living room, possibly sitting on the GreySofa and using the DvdRemote_1 to control the television or media player, while also interacting with the BirdHouseToy in some capacity.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: GreySofa
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "DvdRemote_1 has a high count of 59 in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts, indicating the user observed it intensively. It is likely that the user is considering interacting with this object, possibly to play a DVD."
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "TvRemote_1 has an even higher count of 61 in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts. This suggests a strong likelihood of interaction, as the user may want to adjust the TV settings or channels."
    - object: GreySofa
      reason: "GreySofa also has a significant count of 62, showing that the user has been focused on it. It may imply that the user is considering sitting down after interacting with the remotes."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - GreySofa

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to watch something on the TV or DVD, potentially getting comfortable on the GreySofa while using the remotes to control the media playback.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: GreySofa
      reason: "The GreySofa has a high focus count of 62, indicating it has garnered significant attention from the user, suggesting they may want to interact with it, possibly to sit down or rest."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 also has a high focus count of 59, which suggests that the user is likely considering using it, perhaps to play a DVD or adjust settings related to media content."
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      reason: "The BirdHouseToy has a focus count of 62 as well, indicating a strong possibility of interaction. The user may want to engage with it for play, especially since it also has been present in previous predictions."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - GreySofa
    - DvdRemote_1
    - BirdHouseToy

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is likely to find comfort by interacting with the sofa and possibly using the remote to watch something, while the BirdHouseToy may indicate an interest in play or entertainment within the living space.

    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.3
    - object: GreySofa
      probability: 0.35

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "DvdRemote_1 has a high focus count of 59, indicating that the user has observed it with significant attention. It is also in proximity, being one of the most likely targets for interaction when watching TV or using a DVD player."
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "Similarly, TvRemote_1 has a focus count of 61, which shows it has been observed intensely by the user. Since it is also an important object for media control, it suggests it might be a prioritized interaction."
    - object: GreySofa
      reason: "GreySofa has the same focus count as DvdRemote_1. Although it may not have direct interaction capability, its association with the other objects indicates the user might be adjusting their seating or preparing for a longer interaction with media objects."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - GreySofa

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is to engage with media content, potentially preparing to watch something using the DVD or TV setup in the Living Room while comfortably seated.

      probability: 0.35
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: GreySofa
      reason: "The GreySofa has one of the highest counts in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list, indicating that the user has observed it intensively. It is likely that the user wants to interact with it, possibly to sit down or place an item on it."
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      reason: "The BirdHouseToy also has a high count in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list and appears to be observed very closely by the user, suggesting a strong intent to interact, possibly playing or retrieving it."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 is also among the high-focus items and was observed frequently, pointing towards a likelihood of the user intending to use it to control the TV or access a DVD, especially since it's often needed when engaging with the living room entertainment setup."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - GreySofa
    - BirdHouseToy
    - DvdRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to relax or engage with entertainment in the living room, specifically by possibly sitting on the GreySofa, interacting with the BirdHouseToy, or using the DvdRemote_1 to control playback on the television.

      probability: 0.35
    - object: GreySofa
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 has a high focus count of 59, indicating it was observed intensely for a significant portion of time. It is also nearby with a count of 81, suggesting the user is both focused on it and spends time close to it, increasing the likelihood of interaction."
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "Similar to the DvdRemote_1, the TvRemote_1 has a high focus count of 61 and a nearby count of 83. The close proximity and high observation rate suggest that the user may want to interact with it for viewing purposes."
    - object: GreySofa
      reason: "The GreySofa has equal high counts of 62 for focus and is noted as a comfortable interaction point. While it has slightly less interaction potential compared to the remotes, its high observation counts indicate it may also be a target for user interaction, perhaps for seating or relaxation."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - GreySofa

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to watch television or a movie, as indicated by their focus on remotes and proximity to the sofa, suggesting they are preparing to engage with audiovisual content.
