2024-10-17 11:22:27,134 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.4
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has high focus and proximity counts, indicating the user has been observing it closely and remains near it. It also has a moderate time to approach, suggesting it is a consistent choice for potential interaction.
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife also shows high focus and proximity counts similar to the ChoppingBoard. Though its distance count is slightly lower, its overall engagement makes it a strong candidate for interaction, especially during kitchen-related tasks.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug meets the focus and proximity thresholds, but its time to approach is longer. Despite this, the user's consistent attention indicates it could still be part of their intended interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - KitchenKnife
    - BlackCeramicMug

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare or serve food, likely involving chopping and organizing ingredients, possibly for a meal or snack. The focus on kitchen objects like the ChoppingBoard and KitchenKnife supports this culinary intent.

    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.4
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus consistency count of 55 and is within a close proximity of approximately 0.953 meters, making it a highly probable object for interaction. The time to approach is also reasonable at 35.44 seconds, indicating the user may be planning to use it soon.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard follows closely with a focus count of 54 and a proximity count of 91. It is also close in distance at 0.969 meters. Though the time to approach is longer at 45.36 seconds, its consistent proximity suggests the user may have intentions to engage with it, potentially in conjunction with the KitchenKnife.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan, with a focus count of 72 and a proximity of 91, shows strong engagement as well. Although it has a fairly quick time to approach of 2.35 seconds, it ranks lower in priority compared to the KitchenKnife and ChoppingBoard. However, it remains a relevant option for interaction given its visual engagement and proximity.

    - KitchenKnife
    - ChoppingBoard
    - MuffinPan

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or engage in cooking-related tasks, possibly focusing on cutting or chopping ingredients, as indicated by the focus on kitchen-related objects like knives and cutting boards.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus count (55), is within proximity (0.953m), and requires a reasonable approach time (35.44 seconds). This indicates a strong likelihood of the user planning to interact with it for food preparation tasks.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard also has a significant focus count (54) and a close proximity (0.969m), making it a strong candidate for interaction. The longer approach time compared to the KitchenKnife is offset by its consistent focus. 
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has a solid focus count (72) and is relatively close (1.065m). Though it meets the distance and focus thresholds, the longer approach time means itâ€™s less immediate than the top two, but still very relevant for the user's task.

    - MuffinPan

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to food preparation or cooking, focusing on specific tasks such as chopping ingredients and using the muffin pan for baking.
