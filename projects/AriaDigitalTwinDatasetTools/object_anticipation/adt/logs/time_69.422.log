    - object: BlackCoffeeTable
      probability: 0.35
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.30
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: BlackCoffeeTable
      reason: "The BlackCoffeeTable has the highest focus count at 91, indicating that the user has spent a significant amount of time observing it, suggesting a strong chance of interaction."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1, with a slightly lower count of 74, is also a focal point for the user, indicating they might want to interact with it, especially if they are considering using the TV."
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      reason: "Although the ToothbrushHolder has a lower focus count of 91 compared to the BlackCoffeeTable, it is noted as one of the nearby objects, indicating a probability of interaction given its proximity and relevance in their tasks."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCoffeeTable
    - DvdRemote_1
    - ToothbrushHolder

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to engage with items in the living room that may relate to leisure activities such as entertainment (e.g., using the DvdRemote_1) or organizing items (e.g., manipulating objects on the BlackCoffeeTable).

    - object: BlackCoffeeTable
      probability: 0.40
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCoffeeTable
      reason: "The BlackCoffeeTable has the highest count in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list, suggesting it has garnered the most attention from the user, making it the most likely candidate for interaction."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 also has a significant count, indicating the user was focused on it for a considerable amount of time, and it is relevant for interactions often related to media consumption in a living room setting."
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      reason: "Although not the primary focus, the ToothbrushHolder has been observed among the nearby objects, showing that the user spent time close to it, indicating potential for interaction, especially if they are in a routine related to personal care."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCoffeeTable
    - DvdRemote_1
    - ToothbrushHolder

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is likely to engage in some activity in the living room, possibly involving the BlackCoffeeTable for an item (like a drink or snack), using the DvdRemote_1 for media control, or preparing for a personal routine that involves the ToothbrushHolder.

    - object: DvdRemote_1

    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CandlePattern02_1
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 has a high count of 74 in the high_focus_objects list, indicating that the user likely focused on it for an extended period, suggesting a strong intention to interact with it, possibly to play or navigate a DVD."
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "The TvRemote_1 has a count of 75 in the high_focus_objects list, which is slightly higher than DvdRemote_1. This indicates that it has also garnered significant attention from the user, likely for controlling the TV while in the living room."
    - object: CandlePattern02_1
      reason: "Although CandlePattern02_1 has a lower count of 91 in the high_focus_objects list compared to the remotes, it is also present in the user's quick access objects. This suggests a possibility of it being interacted with for ambiance purposes or decoration, especially if the user is focused on creating a cozy environment."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - CandlePattern02_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is likely to engage in leisure activities in the living room, possibly involving watching a movie or a show while setting the mood with candles.
