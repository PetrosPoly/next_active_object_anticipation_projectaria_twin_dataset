    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard meets the focus and distance thresholds and has the shortest time to approach (0.98 seconds). This suggests a high likelihood that the user intends to interact with it for preparation tasks, such as cutting or preparing food.
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork also meets the distance threshold and has a relatively short time to approach (1.66 seconds). Its proximity consistency indicates that the user is nearby and potentially interested in using it, likely for eating or serving.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A meets the distance and time thresholds but has lower focus counts compared to the first two objects. However, its proximity suggests that the user might be considering it for preparation or consumption, making it a probable interaction.

    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency counts (91) and a time to approach of only 0.98 seconds, which is well within the threshold, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork also has a strong focus consistency count (91) and a reasonable time to approach (1.66 seconds), satisfying both the focus and distance thresholds, which places it as the second probable object.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a significant focus count (91) and a time to approach of 2.01 seconds, slightly above the threshold. However, it is still reasonably close to the user, thus making it a probable choice for interaction.

    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has a high proximity consistency (46 counts) and a relatively low estimated time to approach (0.983 seconds), making it a prime candidate for interaction. It's also highly focused upon, indicating the user might be preparing to chop or assemble ingredients.
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork has considerable proximity consistency (30 counts) and a time to approach of approximately 1.664 seconds. While it doesn't have as high a focus as the ChoppingBoard, its favorable proximity and moderate time indicate a likely next step in the user's task.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: Mango_A has strong focus consistency (91 counts) and is close in proximity (1.447 meters) but has a longer time to approach (1.740 seconds). This suggests that while the user is keenly interested in it, it might not be their immediate next step, but it remains a strong candidate due to the observed focus.

    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus count of 91 and is the closest object at 1.289 meters, with a low approach time of 0.98 seconds. This combination of high focus, close proximity, and low time to approach makes it highly probable that the user intends to interact with it.
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork also has substantial focus and proximity counts, with a proximity of 1.418 meters and an approach time of 1.66 seconds. While it doesn't have as high focus as the ChoppingBoard, it is still significant, positioning it as the next likely candidate for interaction.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A meets the distance and time thresholds and has a significant focus count of 91. Although the ChoppingBoard and WoodenFork have stronger ties, it still presents a good option for interaction given its proximity of 1.447 meters and reasonable approach time.
