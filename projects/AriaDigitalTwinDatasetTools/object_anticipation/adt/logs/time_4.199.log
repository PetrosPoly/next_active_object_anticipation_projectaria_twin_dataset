    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.5
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.3
    - object: N/A
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency count of 91, which indicates strong interest from the user. It is also within a reasonable distance (1.869 meters) and has an approachable estimated time of 2.290 seconds, making it highly probable that the user will interact with it next.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: BlackBarStool_B has a decent focus consistency count of 28 and is slightly closer than the ChoppingBoard at 1.777 meters, with a similar approach time of 2.197 seconds. While it has lower focus counts compared to the ChoppingBoard, it still meets the criteria for distance and time thresholds effectively.
    - object: N/A
      reason: There are no other objects available that fit the thresholds closely enough to warrant a mention. Other objects, if present, must be significantly lower in both focus and distance counts, which disqualifies them from being likely interaction targets at this time.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B
    - N/A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past interactions, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or engage in an activity that involves using the ChoppingBoard, possibly in combination with sitting on or using the BlackBarStool_B.

      probability: 0.6
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has a high focus consistency count (91) and is very close to the user (1.869 meters) with a quick approach time (2.29 seconds). This indicates strong likelihood of interaction as the user has shown significant focus and proximity.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: The BlackBarStool_B, while showing lower focus consistency (28), is still within a reasonable distance (1.777 meters) and requires less time to approach (2.20 seconds). This suggests that it could still be a possible interaction, although it ranks lower than the ChoppingBoard.
    - object: None
      reason: No other objects met the criteria. The focus counts for nearby objects were not significant enough to warrant inclusion, indicating a likely focus on the two primary objects listed.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or engage in cooking activities, as the high focus on the ChoppingBoard suggests these tasks are central to their current intentions.

      probability: 0.6
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus counts (91) and a proximity count of 10, indicating that the user has been observing it very consistently. Although the proximity counts are not the highest, the significant focus suggests that the user is likely to interact with it next, especially if they are preparing food or cooking.
      
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: The BlackBarStool_B has a decent focus count (28) and proximity count (45), showing that while the user's focus is not as high as with the ChoppingBoard, they have spent a good amount of time near it. This suggests that it could serve as a temporary resting place or a vantage point while carrying out their tasks.
      
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other objects that closely fit the user's focus and proximity thresholds to warrant a prediction. The lack of a third object reflects that the user is primarily engaged with the two mentioned objects.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions, the user appears to be in the process of preparing food or engaging in a cooking-related task, given the significant focus and proximity toward the ChoppingBoard and the nearby seating at the BlackBarStool_B for potential breaks or observation during the task.

    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.35
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency count (91) and is the closest object in focus, suggesting strong intent to interact with it. While it does not meet the time threshold, its high focus and proximity counts support a probable future interaction.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: BlackBarStool_B has lower focus consistency (28) but still shows significant proximity (45) counts and is relatively close to the user (1.777m), indicating that the user may be considering interaction despite not being as focused on it as the ChoppingBoard.
    - object: None
      reason: No other objects have enough data to suggest a reasonable chance of interaction, considering the thresholds set.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or engage in cooking activities, as indicated by the focus on the chopping board and proximity to seating (bar stool), suggesting the user may be transitioning between food preparation and meal consumption.

    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.3
    - object: None
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has a focus count of 91, which exceeds the focus threshold of 60. It also has a current distance of 1.869 meters and an estimated time to approach of 2.290 seconds, both of which fall within the proximity and time thresholds. Therefore, it is the most likely object for interaction.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: The BlackBarStool_B has a focus count of 28, which is below the focus threshold but has a high proximity count of 45, and a distance of 1.777 meters with a time to approach of 2.198 seconds. It meets the distance and time thresholds, making it a probable object of interaction but slightly less likely than the ChoppingBoard.
    - object: None
      reason: Since no other objects meet the criteria sufficiently, there is no further object to predict. The focus counts for potential other candidates fall below the relevant thresholds.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or perform a cooking task, as indicated by the high focus and proximity to the ChoppingBoard, which is commonly used for food preparation. The presence of the BlackBarStool_B suggests the user may also be considering a place to sit or place items while engaging in this task.

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus count (91) and a distance count (1.869 meters) that is within the acceptable threshold. It also has a sufficient proximity count (10) indicating the user is likely engaged with it.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: The BlackBarStool_B has a considerable focus count (28) and is within proximity (1.777 meters) indicating that while it doesn't meet the focus threshold, its closeness suggests a possible interaction.
    - object: UnknownObject
      reason: Although this object did not have specific data provided, it is common for users to encounter other objects in a living room when engaged in a task. Therefore, it is included as a less likely but still possible interaction.
