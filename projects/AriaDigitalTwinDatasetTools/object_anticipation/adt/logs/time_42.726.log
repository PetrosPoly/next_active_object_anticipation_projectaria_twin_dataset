      probability: 0.4
    - object: StepLadder_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackRoundTable
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BookBoxSmall_2
      reason: "The BookBoxSmall_2 has a high focus count of 47, indicating the user has observed it with significant attention. Additionally, it also has a notable presence in the nearby objects list, further increasing the likelihood of interaction."
    - object: StepLadder_1
      reason: "The StepLadder_1 has the highest focus count at 91, showing it has drawn considerable attention from the user. Given the context of the living room, the user may need the ladder for reaching items located at higher places."
    - object: BlackRoundTable
      reason: "The BlackRoundTable has a high presence in nearby objects with a count of 91, indicating the user has spent time close to it. While the focus count is lower than the first two objects, its proximity suggests a potential interaction, particularly if the user is looking to set down items or work nearby."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BookBoxSmall_2
    - StepLadder_1
    - BlackRoundTable

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is likely focused on organizing or retrieving items from the BookBoxSmall_2 and possibly using the StepLadder_1 for accessing items on high shelves or in higher places within the living space. The presence of the BlackRoundTable might indicate a need for a flat surface to place or sort items during this activity.

      probability: 0.45
    - object: Bookcase
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteLiddedTrashBin
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: BookBoxSmall_2
      reason: "This object has a high focus count of 47, indicating that the user has been observing it intently. It also appears in the nearby objects list with a significant count, reinforcing its likelihood for interaction as the user may be looking to retrieve or examine its contents."
    - object: Bookcase
      reason: "With a focus count of 91, the user has dedicated a substantial amount of time observing the bookcase, suggesting they might be searching for a specific book or organizing materials. It also ranks high in the nearby object counts, indicating proximity as an additional factor."
    - object: WhiteLiddedTrashBin
      reason: "The WhiteLiddedTrashBin appears in the high focus list and has a lower focus count compared to the first two objects. However, its functional use suggests that the user may decide to dispose of items or organize waste, creating a plausible interaction opportunity."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BookBoxSmall_2
    - Bookcase
    - WhiteLiddedTrashBin

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to organize or search for specific books and potentially dispose of unnecessary items, as reflected by their attention on the book-related objects and the trash bin.

    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.45
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has a high focus count (44) and a strong proximity count (91), indicating that the user has been observing and staying near it frequently. It also has a short time to approach (about 2 seconds), making it a prime candidate for interaction.
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife also has a strong focus count (45) paired with high proximity (91). Although it has a slightly longer time to approach (approximately 2 seconds), its consistently high focus suggests the user is likely planning to use it in conjunction with the ChoppingBoard.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has a considerable focus count (62) and a high proximity score (91) as well, though it ranks lower in time to approach (1.65 seconds). Although it does not have quite the same level of focus as the top two objects, its proximity and consistent presence in the user's focus make it a likely candidate for upcoming interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - KitchenKnife
    - MuffinPan

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and past interactions, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to food preparation or baking, indicated by their concentration on kitchen-related items such as the ChoppingBoard, KitchenKnife, and MuffinPan.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has a high focus count of 44, is within a close distance of 1.034 meters, and has a rapid approach time of approximately 2 seconds, satisfying all thresholds. This combination makes it the most likely object for interaction, especially in a kitchen-related task.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has a focus count of 62, a distance of 1.206 meters, and an approach time of around 1.65 seconds. While it does not meet the time threshold strictly, its strong focus and acceptable proximity suggest it is highly probable that the user will interact with it, particularly if they are baking or preparing food.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug has a focus count of 25 and a proximity consistency count of 91, with the closest distance of 0.826 meters. Though it doesn’t meet the time threshold, the combination of substantial focus and proximity makes it plausible for interaction, likely for serving or drinking purposes.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - MuffinPan
    - BlackCeramicMug

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to food preparation, possibly involving cooking or baking, as evidenced by the focus on kitchenware like the ChoppingBoard and MuffinPan, alongside the BlackCeramicMug for beverage consumption.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has a high focus count of 44, is within close proximity (1.034m), and has a low approach time (2.003 seconds), satisfying all thresholds for interaction likelihood.
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife exhibits a consistent focus count of 45 and is also close by (1.021m), with a quick approach time (approximately 2.036 seconds), making it highly probable for interaction despite being slightly lower in proximity consistency.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has a sufficiently high focus count (62) and is within acceptable distance (1.206m) while having a reasonable approach time (1.653 seconds), thus making it probable although it doesn’t fully meet the time threshold.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has high focus consistency counts (44) and is within close proximity (1.034 meters). It also has a quick approach time (approximately 2 seconds), making it a prime candidate for interaction as it likely plays a key role in food preparation.
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife shows strong focus counts (45), is very close (1.021 meters), and has a similar approach time (about 2 seconds). This suggests the user is likely preparing to cut or slice something, which aligns with the overarching task of food preparation.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has notable focus consistency (62 counts) and proximity (1.206 meters), with a slightly less urgent approach time (around 1.65 seconds). This indicates that while it may not be the immediate focus, it is still relevant for the user’s ongoing task, likely related to baking or cooking.
