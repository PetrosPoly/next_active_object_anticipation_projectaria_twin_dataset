    - object: GreenApple_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.30
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: GreenApple_A
      reason: "This object has the highest focus count of 57, indicating that the user has observed it for a significant portion of the time window, suggesting strong intent to interact with it."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug has a focus count of 47 and a nearby count of 64, showing that the user is likely interested in it and has spent considerable time in proximity to it."
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "With a focus count of 58 and a nearby count of 42, the CakeMocha_A is another strong candidate for interaction, suggesting it captured the user's attention recently."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - GreenApple_A
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - CakeMocha_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to select and possibly consume a snack or beverage, as indicated by the high focus on food-related items in the living room.

    - object: GreenApple_A
      probability: 0.34
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.33
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.33

rationale:
    - object: GreenApple_A
      reason: "The GreenApple_A has the highest count in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list, indicating it has captured the user's attention the most. Additionally, it appears in the 'nearby_objects_measured_in_counts' list, suggesting a longer period spent near it, amplifying the likelihood of interaction."
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "CakeMocha_A has a high count in both the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' and 'nearby_objects_measured_in_counts' lists, showing that the user is likely interested in interacting with it. Its proximity and focus counts suggest it is a desired choice."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug also has a strong showing in both lists, indicating considerable attention and presence nearby. As itâ€™s a common item for beverages, its interaction probability remains high, especially given its placement among other frequently observed items."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - GreenApple_A
    - CakeMocha_A
    - BlackCeramicMug

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is likely to enjoy or consume refreshments, specifically fruit and coffee or cake, indicating a possible break or snack time in the living room.
