2024-10-17 11:24:06,831 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CandlePattern04_1
      probability: 0.4
    - object: CandlePattern02_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CandlePattern04_1
      reason: CandlePattern04_1 has high focus consistency (91 counts) and is within proximity (1.439 meters) with a time to approach of 1.488 seconds, satisfying all thresholds. This indicates a strong likelihood of interaction due to consistent observation and closeness.
    - object: CandlePattern02_1
      reason: CandlePattern02_1 also meets the focus threshold (91 counts) and has an acceptable proximity (1.489 meters) with a time to approach of 1.616 seconds. This makes it a strong candidate for interaction based on the user's behavior pattern.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 has a moderate focus (59 counts) but falls just above the distance threshold (1.391 meters) and has a longer approach time (4.622 seconds). While itâ€™s less favored than the first two objects, the focus and proximity indicators suggest it's still a plausible interaction point.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CandlePattern04_1
    - CandlePattern02_1
    - DvdRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to arranging or managing items within the living room, particularly focusing on decorative elements (the candles) and potentially engaging with electronic devices (like the remote).
