    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan has the highest count in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list, indicating it has garnered the most user attention over the observation period. This suggests a strong likelihood that the user intends to use it, possibly for baking or serving."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug has a significant count in both the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' and 'nearby_objects_measured_in_counts' lists. Its relevance in terms of possible beverage use also adds to the likelihood of interaction."
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: "The WhiteFlatwareTray is also prominent in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list, indicating that it has been observed with intention. It might be needed for serving or organizing food items."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - MuffinPan
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - WhiteFlatwareTray

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or serve food items, possibly involving baking, serving snacks or beverages, which connects to the previously predicted objects like bowls and trays.

    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan has the highest count (61), indicating that the user has observed it intensely the most and likely has a strong intention to interact with it."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug has a high focus count (58) and is also present in the nearby objects list with a considerable count, suggesting that the user may want to interact with it for a beverage or food."
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: "The WhiteFlatwareTray has a significant focus count (63) and is likely to be used in conjunction with the other objects, implying the user may want to organize or place items on it."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - MuffinPan
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - WhiteFlatwareTray

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare a meal or snack involving muffins, and they may be setting up to serve or enjoy food and beverages comfortably.

    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan has the highest focus count (61), suggesting strong user intention to interact with it, likely for baking or preparation."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug also has a significant focus count (58) and is among the user's nearby objects, indicating a likely desire for a drink or preparation with it."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "While lower in focus count (57), Jam_Anon is also a nearby object and could be needed in conjunction with the MuffinPan, indicating the user may be making something to spread or accompany."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - MuffinPan
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - Jam_Anon

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare a meal or snack, potentially involving baking, and they might be looking to enjoy it with something to drink.

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan has the highest focus count (61) and a significant nearby count (46), indicating that the user has spent considerable time observing and was nearby, making it the most likely object for interaction."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug has a strong presence with a high focus count (58) and close proximity via nearby counts (35), suggesting that the user is likely to interact with it for possibly pouring or serving a beverage."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "The Jam_Anon also shows significant focus (57 counts) and is in the realm of potential nearby interactions, but with slightly lower counts than the first two, making it a somewhat less likely but still probable choice."
