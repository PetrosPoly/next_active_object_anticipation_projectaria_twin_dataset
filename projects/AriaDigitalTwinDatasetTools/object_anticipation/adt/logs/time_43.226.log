rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "This object has the highest proximity counts and is the closest to the user at a distance of 0.978 meters. It also has a significant number of focus counts (36), making it a strong candidate for interaction."
    - object: RedClock
      reason: "The RedClock shows high focus counts (47) and a very close approach time (2.705 seconds), while proximity counts can indicate the user has spent time near it, making it a likely object for interaction next."
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: "Although it has lower focus counts (17), it is close and likely in the user's path based on proximity counts (91). This suggests that while it might not have been a primary focus, its immediate usability may lead to interaction, particularly if the user’s activities necessitate reaching for utensils."

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "This object has a high proximity consistency count of 91 and a focus count of 36, indicating both high attention and close nearness. Additionally, its time to approach is very low (approximately 0.94 seconds), making it highly probable for interaction."
    - object: RedClock
      reason: "The RedClock also shows high focus and proximity counts (47 and 91, respectively), suggesting consistent attention and frequent pass-by. However, it lacks a specific interaction time metric, putting it slightly lower in probability than the CoffeeCanisterLarge."
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard has moderate focus (30 counts), high proximity (91 counts), and a reasonable approach time of around 21.67 seconds. While it does meet the focus and distance criteria, its longer approach time makes it less likely than the first two."
