    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.30
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: "The KitchenKnife has the highest focus (69 counts) and is within an approach distance of 1.358 meters, needing about 4.63 seconds to reach. It fulfills all three thresholds, making it highly probable that the user will interact with it."
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard has a strong focus count (70 counts) and is close in proximity (1.376 meters). The approach time of about 4.55 seconds indicates it's likely to be interacted with. It satisfies both focus and proximity conditions."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "Jam_Anon shows high focus (77 counts) and minimal distance (0.828 meters), with an approach time of about 4.82 seconds. Although it meets focus and proximity thresholds, it falls slightly short on time, making it a probable choice to interact with next."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - KitchenKnife
    - ChoppingBoard
    - Jam_Anon

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or make something that requires the use of ingredients, possibly involving chopping or mixing, as suggested by the interaction with the KitchenKnife and ChoppingBoard along with a condiment like Jam_Anon.

      probability: 0.35
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.30
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: "The KitchenKnife has a high focus count of 69 and strong proximity counts, indicating that the user is likely preparing food and intends to use it for chopping or slicing."
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard shows a very high focus count of 70 and a considerable proximity count, suggesting that it is essential for the user's food preparation activities and the user is closely examining it."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "The Jam_Anon has a focus count of 77, which is significant, although its proximity counts are not as strong as the first two objects. However, the user is nearby, and it might be an intended addition to whatever they are preparing."

    - KitchenKnife
    - ChoppingBoard
    - Jam_Anon

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is related to food preparation, likely involving chopping ingredients and utilizing condiments like jam in their cooking or meal assembly.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus count (70) and is within a reasonable distance of 1.376 meters, with a decent time to approach of 4.546 seconds. It represents a central point for food preparation, aligning with tasks that involve cutting or chopping."
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: "The KitchenKnife has a strong focus count (69) and proximity consistency (91), making it a logical next choice. It is slightly more distant at 1.358 meters, but the high focus indicates sustained observation, suggesting the user intends to use it alongside the ChoppingBoard."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "Although the Jam_Anon has the highest focus count (77) and is quite close (0.828 meters), its average time to approach is 4.817 seconds. This indicates potential interaction, likely in a sequential task involving food preparation or serving, but its probability is moderated compared to the ChoppingBoard and KitchenKnife."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - KitchenKnife
    - Jam_Anon

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or serve a meal, as evidenced by the selection of objects related to food preparation and serving.
