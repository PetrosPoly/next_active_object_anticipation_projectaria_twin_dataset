    - object: WoodenBowl
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenBowl
      reason: The WoodenBowl has the highest proximity counts (58) and a respectable focus count (25). It is also relatively close to the user (1.245 meters), making it a prime candidate for interaction.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A has a high focus count (36) and an even closer distance (1.220 meters) to the user. The time to approach (approximately 2.96 seconds) is very low, suggesting that the user may be likely to interact with it next.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl shows strong focus counts (37) while being moderately close (1.275 meters). Although its proximity count is low (53), it still stands out as a potential object of interest.

    - WoodenBowl
    - Mango_A
    - BlackCeramicBowl

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or serving food, given the objects they are focusing on and interacting with in the Living Room setting.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: Mango_A has a focus count of 36 (above the focus threshold of 30) and a low distance of 1.220 meters, indicating it is nearby and has caught the user’s attention. The time to approach is also reasonable at 2.961 seconds, making it a prime candidate for interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a focus count of 37 and is close at 1.275 meters, fulfilling both focus and distance criteria. The time to approach is longer at 13.531 seconds, but its high focus count suggests it is still likely to be interacted with.
    - object: Flask
      reason: The Flask meets the proximity threshold with a distance of 1.720 meters and has significant focus at 41 counts. However, its time to approach is a bit lengthy at 18.156 seconds. Despite this, its proximity and focus indicate a reasonable chance for interaction.

    - Mango_A
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - Flask

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food or a drink, as indicated by the focus on items such as the Mango_A, BlackCeramicBowl, and Flask, which are all associated with food and beverage preparation.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a high focus count of 37 and is close to the user (1.275 meters), indicating that it has likely captured the user's attention. Additionally, it has a reasonable time to approach (13.53 seconds), which aligns with the user's behavior patterns observed in the living room, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A is also very close (1.220 meters) and has a moderately high focus count of 36. It has a relatively short time to approach (2.96 seconds), suggesting that the user is likely to interact with it soon. This combination of proximity and focus makes it the second most likely object for interaction.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: The CakeMocha_A shows good focus (38 counts) and proximity (1.421 meters). Despite a longer time to approach (4.5 seconds), its significant focus count indicates that the user is interested in it for some reason, likely indicating that it’s part of the user’s current task or goal.

    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - Mango_A
    - CakeMocha_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare or serve food, likely focused on gathering ingredients or setting the table, as indicated by the presence of both food items (like Mango_A) and serving items (like BlackCeramicBowl and CakeMocha_A).

      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenBowl
      probability: 0.35

      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has high focus counts (37), a proximity count of 53, and a reasonable approach time (13.5 seconds). It meets the focus threshold and has strong proximity, suggesting it is highly likely to be interacted with.
    - object: WoodenBowl
      reason: The WoodenBowl shows a focus count of 25 and the highest proximity count (58). With a low approach time of about 1.7 seconds, it satisfies the key thresholds which increases its likelihood despite not hitting the focus threshold robustly.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A has a moderate focus count (36) and high proximity (56). It also has a short approach time (around 3 seconds), meeting both the distance and time criteria making it still probable for interaction.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or serving food, as they appear to be focusing on various bowls and a fruit, which are commonly involved in such activities.
