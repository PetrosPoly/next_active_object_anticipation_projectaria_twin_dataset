2024-10-17 11:10:15,080 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork has the highest focus consistency (84 counts) and is also the closest object (1.089 meters) with a time to approach under 2 seconds (9.025 seconds). This combination suggests a strong likelihood for interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has substantial focus counts (73), is within a close distance (1.145 meters), and requires a short approach time (2.427 seconds). It meets the focus and distance criteria, making it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: CakeMocha_A has considerable focus counts (83) but does not meet the time threshold, though it is relatively close (1.356 meters). This indicates a likelihood of interaction, albeit lower than the first two objects.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WoodenFork
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - CakeMocha_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or enjoying a meal or treat, possibly focusing on serving or eating, given the presence of food-related items like the WoodenFork and CakeMocha_A, alongside the BlackCeramicBowl which could be used for serving or mixing ingredients.
