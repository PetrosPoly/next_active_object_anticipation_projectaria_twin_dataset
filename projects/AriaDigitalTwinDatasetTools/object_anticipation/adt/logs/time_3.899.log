      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency count of 84, indicating strong user interest. Although its proximity consistency is low (1 count), it is still within a reasonable distance of 1.999 meters, and the time to approach it (3.46 seconds) is under the threshold of 5 seconds. This combination of high focus and acceptable approach time makes it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: The BlackBarStool_B has a focus count of 28 and a proximity count of 36, showing that the user has observed it sufficiently while remaining nearby. Its distance is slightly further (1.817 meters) and with an approach time of 6.1 seconds, it does not meet the time threshold. However, the moderate focus and proximity suggest it may still be a possible object of interest.
    - object: None
      reason: Since there are no other objects that meet the selection criteria significantly, this option indicates the low likelihood of additional interactions at this time.
