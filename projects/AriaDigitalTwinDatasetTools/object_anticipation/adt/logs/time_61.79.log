    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Cereal_Anon
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask has the highest focus count of 58, a proximity count of 91, and a reasonable time to approach of 4.13 seconds. This makes it a highly probable object for interaction."
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "Despite having lower focus counts (57), the Tomato_A has decent proximity (68) and the shortest time to approach (1.89 seconds), which suggests a likelihood of interaction."
    - object: Cereal_Anon
      reason: "Although Cereal_Anon has lower focus (17) and approach time (10.37 seconds), it maintains high proximity (91) which indicates that the user may still consider it for interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Flask
    - Tomato_A
    - Cereal_Anon

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare a meal or snack, as they are focusing on food-related objects within the living room setting.

    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has the highest focus consistency count (18) and is also very close to the user (0.859 meters), indicating both an interest in and accessibility to this object."
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask has a strong focus consistency count (58) and proximity (1.134 meters) along with a reasonably low time to approach (4.13 seconds), making it a likely candidate for interaction."
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "Though the Tomato_A has a lower focus count (57), it is quite close to the user (1.067 meters) and falls within the low time to approach (1.89 seconds), indicating a possible interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - Flask
    - Tomato_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or organize food, as evidenced by past interactions focusing on kitchen-related objects like bowls, dishes, and food items.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has the highest focus count (18) and is within close proximity (0.859 meters) with a short approach time (7.486 seconds), meeting both the focus and proximity criteria while being a probable object for interaction."
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask shows strong focus consistency (58 counts) and is also close (1.134 meters), with a time of 4.133 seconds to approach, making it highly likely for interaction given the userâ€™s previous focus."
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "Although its proximity and focus counts (57 for focus, 68 for proximity) are strong, the approach time (1.892 seconds) is suitable but not as immediate as the first two items; however, it still signifies a likelihood based on prior engagement."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - Flask
    - Tomato_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or serve food, given the items they are interacting with focus on bowls, flasks, and food ingredients like tomatoes, indicating potential meal preparation or presentation activities.
