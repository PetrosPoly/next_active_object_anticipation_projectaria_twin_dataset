    - object: WoodenBowl
      probability: 0.30
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl has the highest count in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list, indicating that the user has observed it intensively (91 counts) during the last time window. This suggests a strong intention to interact with it."

    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "Although the ChoppingBoard has a slightly lower focus count (71 counts compared to the WoodenBowl), it has an additional presence in the nearby_objects_measured_in_counts (34 counts). This suggests that the user may be considering using it after observing other objects, adding to its likelihood of interaction."
