    - object: BirdHouseToy
      probability: 0.34
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.27

rationale:
    - object: GreySofa
      reason: "The GreySofa has the highest count (77) in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list, indicating significant observation. It’s likely the user intends to interact with it, possibly for seating or to reach for something nearby."
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      reason: "The BirdHouseToy shows a high count (54) in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list, suggesting it has captured the user's attention sufficiently. Its presence in nearby objects further reinforces the likelihood of interaction."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 has a high count (91) in the nearby_objects_measured_in_counts list, reflecting a potential interaction as the user may be planning to watch something or adjust the TV settings."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - GreySofa
    - BirdHouseToy
    - DvdRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to find a comfortable spot to relax or watch something, potentially using the remote, while also considering playing with or interacting with the BirdHouseToy, possibly as a fun activity in the living room.

      probability: 0.40
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: GreySofa
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "DvdRemote_1 has a high focus count of 35 and is also strongly present in the nearby objects list with a count of 91, indicating prolonged attention and proximity, suggesting a likely interaction."
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "Similarly, TvRemote_1 exhibits significant attention with a focus count of 36 and proximity count of 91, making it a strong candidate for interaction as the user may be considering watching something."
    - object: GreySofa
      reason: "GreySofa has the highest focus count (77) among the objects evaluated, suggesting the user may want to sit down or interact with it, although its lesser proximity count compared to the remotes indicates it's somewhat less likely for immediate interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - GreySofa

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to settle in the living room, possibly to watch a DVD or TV, as indicated by the focus on the remotes and the sofa.

    - object: GreySofa
      probability: 0.33
    - object: CandlePattern02_1
      probability: 0.29

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 has a high focus count of 35 and a high proximity count of 91, indicating the user has observed it closely and has spent significant time nearby, suggesting a likely intention to interact with it."
    - object: GreySofa
      reason: "GreySofa has the highest focus count of 77, indicating that the user has been paying considerable attention to it. It’s possible the user is looking to sit down or use the space around it for relaxation or other activities."
    - object: CandlePattern02_1
      reason: "CandlePattern02_1 shows a balance of a strong focus count of 33 along with high proximity counts, indicating an interest in potentially using or rearranging the candles for aesthetic purposes or a specific task."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - GreySofa
    - CandlePattern02_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is likely to engage in activities related to leisure, such as watching television or relaxing on the sofa, potentially enhanced by arranging or lighting candles for ambiance.

      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      reason: "The BirdHouseToy has the highest focus count of 54, indicating that the user spent significant time observing it, suggesting a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: GreySofa
      reason: "The GreySofa, with a focus count of 77, is another object that caught the user's attention; however, it is more likely that the user might interact with it for relaxation or to place items rather than direct manipulation."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 has a nearby count of 91, indicating the user has spent considerable time near it. It appears to be a practical choice for interaction, especially if the user is considering watching something."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BirdHouseToy
    - GreySofa
    - DvdRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to find an item to play with or engage in some leisure activities, possibly with attention towards the BirdHouseToy as a key interactive item and the possibility of using the DvdRemote_1 to initiate entertainment.

    - object: BirdHouseToy
      reason: "The BirdHouseToy also shows a significant focus count of 54, coupled with a high nearby count of 76. This indicates that the user was not only focusing on it but was also in close proximity for a substantial period."
    - object: WoodenToothbrushHolder
      reason: "Although the WoodenToothbrushHolder has a lower focus count of 66, its strong presence in the nearby list indicates that the user has lingered near it, increasing the probability that they might interact with it next."

    - GreySofa
    - BirdHouseToy
    - WoodenToothbrushHolder

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is likely to find a comfortable spot to relax or play in the Living Room, potentially involving interaction with toys or items related to comfort and leisure, given the focus on the sofa and nearby toys.
