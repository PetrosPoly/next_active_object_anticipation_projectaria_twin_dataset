      probability: 0.2
    - object: None
      probability: 0.1

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus count (46) and also meets the proximity count equivalently (46). Additionally, it has a time to approach of 4.85 seconds, which is below the threshold of 5 seconds, making it the most probable object of interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a high focus count (17) and a proximity count (46), but it spends more time to approach (22.89 seconds), which is above the desired threshold. This puts it in a secondary position for interaction but still makes it a candidate due to its consistency in the user's focus and proximity.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other relevant objects that meet the criteria for interaction, hence a placeholder with minimal probability is assigned.

    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has a very high focus consistency count of 46 and is also very close to the user (1.029 meters), making it highly probable that the user will interact with it. Additionally, the time to approach is within the acceptable threshold, further solidifying its prediction as the top candidate.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: While the RedClock does have significant proximity and focus counts, the focus count is lower than that of the CoffeeCanisterLarge. However, as the user is very close (1.118 meters) and has spent considerable time with it, it is still predicted to be the second most likely object for interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: No third object meets the criteria necessary for interaction. The focus and distance measurements for other potential objects are not strong enough to suggest interaction.
