2024-10-16 20:53:05,537 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.7
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.3
    - object: None
      probability: 0.0

rationale:
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has the highest proximity counts (91) indicating that the user is very close to it, supporting the likelihood of interaction. Additionally, its focus counts (15) are above the threshold, making it a strong candidate for interaction based on the user's behavior.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: Although the BlackBarStool_B has a high focus count (26), it does not have as strong proximity counts (11) compared to the RedClock. However, it still meets the focus threshold, making it a potential option for the user. Its time to approach is also reasonable, so it remains probable despite the lower proximity counts.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - RedClock
    - BlackBarStool_B

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and user behavior, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to check the time on the RedClock and may consider sitting on the BlackBarStool_B afterwards. The user seems to be navigating through the living room with specific intentions.
