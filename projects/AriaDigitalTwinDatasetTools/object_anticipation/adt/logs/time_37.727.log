    - object: WhiteTrashBin
      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Pestel
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteTrashBin
      reason: The WhiteTrashBin has the highest focus and proximity counts, indicating that the user has spent significant time observing and is in close proximity to it, making it a very likely candidate for interaction.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon also has a solid focus count combined with a close distance, meeting the proximity and focus thresholds, which suggests the user is likely to interact with it next.
    - object: Pestel
      reason: The Pestel meets the distance and time thresholds, but has a slightly lower focus count than the previous two objects. This makes it a probable choice for interaction, though less likely than the first two.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WhiteTrashBin
    - WoodenSpoon
    - Pestel

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or cleaning up after a cooking process, as evidenced by the focused objects that include utensils and containers associated with food preparation.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteTrashBin
      reason: The WhiteTrashBin has the highest focus and proximity counts, indicating that the user has been consistently observing and remaining near it. It also meets the time threshold for approach, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon has a strong focus count and proximity consistency. While it slightly fails the time threshold, the close proximity suggests that it is likely to be one of the next interactions.
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: The Jam_Anon shows a good level of focus and proximity counts, but it just falls short on the time threshold. However, given its presence in the userâ€™s focus and proximity, it remains a probable interaction choice.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WhiteTrashBin
    - WoodenSpoon
    - Jam_Anon

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to organize or clean up items in the Living Room, possibly incorporating cooking or food preparation tasks, as indicated by the focus on kitchen-related items and the trash bin.
