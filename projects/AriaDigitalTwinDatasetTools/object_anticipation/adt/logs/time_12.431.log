      probability: 0.35
    - object: BambooPlate
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan has the highest focus consistency count (78), proximity count (62), and a favorable time to approach (2.1 seconds), indicating a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug meets the focus count threshold (73) and is relatively close (1.17 meters) with a reasonable time to approach (4.06 seconds), suggesting potential interaction."
    - object: BambooPlate
      reason: "The BambooPlate maintains strong focus consistency (76) and is within a reachable distance (1.27 meters), even though its time to approach is slightly longer (3.81 seconds), making it a probable candidate."

    - object: Mortar
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan has a high focus count of 78, a proximity count of 62, and a short time to approach of 2.1 seconds. It meets all thresholds, making it the top candidate for interaction."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug has a strong focus count of 73 and proximity count of 51, but it does not meet the time threshold as it takes 4.1 seconds to approach. This places it next in line for probable interaction."
    - object: Mortar
      reason: "The Mortar has a focus count of 47 and a proximity count of 53, and it also has an approach time of 2.4 seconds, making it a viable option despite falling short of the time threshold."

      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan has the highest focus count (78) and a low distance (0.978 meters), combined with a short approach time (2.099 seconds). This makes it a highly probable object for interaction."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug has strong focus consistency (73 counts) and proximity (51 counts). Although its approach time (4.059 seconds) is slightly over the threshold, it meets the focus and proximity criteria, indicating a likelihood of interaction."
    - object: Mortar
      reason: "The Mortar has significant focus consistency (47 counts) and proximity (53 counts), along with an approach time (2.373 seconds) under the threshold. This combination suggests that it is still a probable candidate for interaction."

      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan has the highest focus (78 counts) and is within close proximity (0.978 meters) but does not exceed the time threshold. It shows sustained observation, indicating that the user is likely considering interaction with it."
    - object: BambooPlate
      reason: "The BambooPlate has a strong focus count (76 counts) and acceptable proximity (1.273 meters), and while it also does not meet the time threshold, the user's consistent observation suggests a high probability of interaction."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug shows good focus (73 counts) and proximity (1.170 meters) but fails the time threshold. However, being within closer range and having significant focus could lead the user to interact with it."

    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug displays a strong focus count (73) and a proximity count (51), which indicates that the user is likely considering it. Although its time to approach (4.0 seconds) is slightly below the threshold, the combination of high focus and proximity makes it a strong candidate."
    - object: Mortar
      reason: "The Mortar shows consistent focus (47) and proximity (53) counts. While its time to approach (2.4 seconds) is within range, it does not exceed the threshold. However, the balance of focus and proximity puts it in the running for potential interaction."
