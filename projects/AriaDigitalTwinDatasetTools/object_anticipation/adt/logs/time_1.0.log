      probability: 0.45
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.35
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The Coffee Canister has the highest focus (31 counts), distance (1.033 meters), and an extremely low time to approach (2.4 seconds), which satisfies all the thresholds. This indicates a high likelihood of interaction due to the user's strong focus and proximity.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The White Utensil Tray also has a strong focus (31 counts) and a very close distance (1.004 meters), along with an approaching time of approximately 1.14 seconds. While it meets focus and distance thresholds, it does not specifically exceed the time threshold significantly, placing it as the second most likely candidate for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: While the Red Clock has a high focus count (17 counts) and proximity (1.072 meters), it does not meet the time threshold (114 seconds). As such, it has a lower probability due to the lack of urgency suggested by the time it would take to approach, but is still a possible target for interaction given its focus and distance.

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest proximity and focus counts, coupled with a very short time to approach, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The WhiteUtensilTray also shows significant focus and proximity counts, along with a quick time to approach, indicating that it is likely the second choice for interaction after the CoffeeCanisterLarge.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although the RedClock has high focus and proximity counts, its longer estimated time to approach relative to the other objects reduces its likelihood of immediate interaction, placing it third in priority.

      reason: This object has the highest consistency in focus counts (31) and is within a proximity where the user is likely to interact with it (1.033 meters). It also has a very short time to approach (2.4 seconds), which makes it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: This object also has a high focus count (31) and is the closest object (1.004 meters). It has an estimated time to approach of just over 1 second, making it a strong candidate for interaction after the CoffeeCanisterLarge.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: While it has decent focus (17 counts), its distance (1.072 meters) and time to approach (114.4 seconds) place it lower on the list. Despite meeting the focus and distance thresholds, the significantly high time to approach means it's less likely to be interacted with compared to the previous two.

      reason: This object has the same focus consistency (31 counts) as the Coffee Canister but is slightly closer (1.004 meters) and has a shorter approach time (1.14 seconds). Its likelihood remains high due to this proximity and the focus consistency.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although it has a reasonable focus (17 counts) and is within a manageable distance (1.072 meters), its time to approach (114.44 seconds) significantly exceeds the threshold, making its probability lower compared to the other two objects.
