2024-10-17 11:23:21,601 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.5
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.3
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: TvRemote_1 has the highest focus count (44) and a close distance (1.225 meters) with a short approach time (1.857 seconds), making it highly probable that the user will interact with it soon.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 also has a significant focus count (33) and is in similar proximity (1.200 meters) with a quick approach time (2.060 seconds), indicating potential interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although RedClock does not have the same high counts as the remotes, it is part of the user's past predictions and may be considered due to ongoing monitoring, even if the time threshold is not met.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - TvRemote_1
    - DvdRemote_1
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to watch something on TV or a DVD, indicating a desire to engage with media content in the living room environment.
