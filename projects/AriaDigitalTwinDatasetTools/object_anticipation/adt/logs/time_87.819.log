    - object: BlackKitchenChair_B
      probability: 0.45
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackTablet
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: BlackKitchenChair_B
      reason: "This object has the highest count (59) in the high focus objects list, indicating significant attention from the user, suggesting they are likely interested in this chair."
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "With a count of 56, this object also shows a high focus level and is frequently present in both the high focus and nearby objects, indicating a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: BlackTablet
      reason: "Despite a lower count in high focus (but high in nearby counts), the presence of the BlackTablet in close proximity and quick access zones implies that the user might be inclined to interact with it after considering the other objects."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackKitchenChair_B
    - CakeMocha_A
    - BlackTablet

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to engage with items of comfort and convenience, potentially preparing to sit down or enjoy a snack, while also considering using electronic devices nearby for entertainment or information.
