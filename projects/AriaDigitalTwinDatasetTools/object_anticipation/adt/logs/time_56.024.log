    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.30
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask has the highest observation count, indicating it has been the focus of attention for a significant amount of time, suggesting an intention to interact with it."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl also has a high observation count, and it is among the top items that the user seemed interested in previously, reinforcing its likelihood for interaction."
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard appears frequently in previous predictions, indicating that the user consistently intends to use it, combined with a moderate observation count suggesting it remains in focus."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Flask
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - ChoppingBoard

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or serve food, likely involving ingredients and utensils that require the use of the Flask for liquids, the BlackCeramicBowl for mixing or holding food items, and the ChoppingBoard as a surface for cutting or preparing ingredients.

      probability: 0.33
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.32
    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.35

rationale:
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask has the highest count (86) in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list, indicating significant attention from the user. Its proximity is also implied as it is likely to be one of the last observed objects."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl also has a high attention count (83), showing the user has likely considered interacting with it. Its consistent presence in previous observations reinforces its significance."
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "With a count of 84, Tomato_A indicates that it has been extensively focused on by the user, suggesting that they might be considering it for a task, likely related to food preparation or cooking."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Flask
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - Tomato_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare a meal or snack, possibly involving the ingredients and utensils observed, indicating a focus on cooking or food assembly activities.

    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.30
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask has the highest count in the high_focus_objects list (86), indicating it has captured significant attention from the user. Its presence suggests it may contain a liquid or be part of a preparation task."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "The BlackCeramicBowl ranks high in both the focus counts (83) and generally appears as an object of interest in the previous predictions, indicating it is likely part of a task involving food preparation or serving."
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "The CakeMocha_A has a high focus count (80) and appears in past observations as a potential item of interest for the user, suggesting it might be intended for consumption or presentation."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Flask
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - CakeMocha_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or serve food, likely involving the Flask for liquid and the bowls for food presentation or serving. The presence of the CakeMocha_A indicates the user could be planning to serve or enjoy a dessert, suggesting a social or celebratory setup.
