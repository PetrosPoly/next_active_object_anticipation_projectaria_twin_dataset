    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.38
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.32
    - object: SpiceJarSalt
      probability: 0.30

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: "The KitchenKnife has a high proximity count (65), indicating the user has spent a considerable amount of time near it, suggesting an intention to use it for cutting or preparing food."
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard also has a high proximity count (65) and is often used in conjunction with a kitchen knife. This suggests the user may want to prepare ingredients, making it a likely candidate for interaction."
    - object: SpiceJarSalt
      reason: "Although SpiceJarSalt has a lower focus count (48) compared to the other two, it is still significant. Given that the user is likely preparing food, they may want to season their dish, which increases its likelihood of interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - KitchenKnife
    - ChoppingBoard
    - SpiceJarSalt

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare a meal, likely involving cutting ingredients and seasoning them as part of the cooking process.
