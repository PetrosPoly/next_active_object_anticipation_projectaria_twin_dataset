    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      probability: 0.4
    - object: DinoToy
      probability: 0.35
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: "It has the highest focus count (60) and is also present in the nearby objects list, indicating sustained attention and likely intention to interact."
    - object: DinoToy
      reason: "With a focus count of 56, the DinoToy shows strong user interest and is likely a playful object that the user may want to engage with."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote has a high focus count (55) as well, suggesting that the user might want to interact with it to control a media device."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicDishSmall
    - DinoToy
    - DvdRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is to interact with items that enhance their living room experience, possibly involving food preparation (using the dish), play (with the toy), or media control (using the remote).

      probability: 0.45
    - object: DinoToy
      probability: 0.35
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: "The BlackCeramicDishSmall has a high focus count of 60, suggesting the user observed it intensely for a significant duration. Additionally, it appears in the nearby objects with a count of 31, indicating prolonged proximity."
    - object: DinoToy
      reason: "The DinoToy has a focus count of 56, indicating that it also received considerable attention. It likely reflects the user's intent to interact, especially given its high focus count relative to others."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 has a focus count of 55, showing that it attracted the user's observation. Although its proximity counts are not as high as the others, it's a common object for interaction in the living room context."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicDishSmall
    - DinoToy
    - DvdRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to engage with items relevant to relaxation or entertainment in the living room, potentially preparing for a meal or playtime.

    - object: DinoToy
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: "This object has the highest count (60) in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list, indicating that the user has observed it intensely, suggesting a strong intention to interact."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "With a significant count of 55 in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list, the user likely intends to interact with this object, possibly for controlling a media player."
    - object: DinoToy
      reason: "Although it has a slightly lower count (56) compared to the DvdRemote_1, it still represents an object of interest to the user, possibly for play or decorative use."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicDishSmall
    - DvdRemote_1
    - DinoToy

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to organize items in the living room, possibly preparing for a meal with the BlackCeramicDishSmall or engaging with media using the DvdRemote_1, while also considering the DinoToy, which may be part of a playful activity or decor adjustment.

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: "This object has the highest focus count (60) among all observed objects, indicating that the user has paid considerable attention to it, suggesting a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "With a focus count of 55 and being one of the nearby objects, the DvdRemote_1 is likely relevant for the user's activities in the Living Room, potentially indicating a desire to control media."
    - object: DinoToy
      reason: "Although it has a slightly lower count (56), the DinoToy is another high-focus object, and its presence suggests it is possibly involved in a play activity or part of a game that the user might want to engage with."
