      probability: 0.4
    - object: Pestel
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteTrashBin
      reason: "The WhiteTrashBin has the highest focus count of 45, meets proximity criteria, and has quick access time of 0.84 seconds, making it the most likely object for interaction."
    - object: Pestel
      reason: "The Pestel has a strong focus count of 22, is close to the user with a distance of 0.727 meters, and has reasonable access time of 1.93 seconds, indicating it is probable for interaction next."
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: "The WoodenSpoon is also likely due to its significant focus count of 38 and proximity (1.028 meters), alongside a quick access time of 3.14 seconds, fitting within the selection criteria as well."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WhiteTrashBin
    - Pestel
    - WoodenSpoon

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to completing a task involving preparation or cooking, indicated by the focus on kitchenware and tools. The presence of items like the Pestel and WoodenSpoon further suggests food preparation or mixing activities.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteTrashBin
      reason: "This object has the highest focus (45 counts) and proximity consistency (46 counts), indicating strong user attention. Additionally, the distance (1.631 meters) is well within the userâ€™s reach, making interaction highly probable."
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: "The WoodenSpoon has a high focus count (38 counts) and a distance of 1.028 meters, both of which suggest the user is likely considering it for interaction. Proximity is also solid (48 counts), which supports this likelihood."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "While the focus count (25 counts) is below the threshold, the Jam_Anon satisfies the distance (0.897 meters) and has strong proximity consistency (49 counts). This implies the user may have an interest in this object, although with a slightly lower probability compared to the others."

    - WhiteTrashBin
    - WoodenSpoon
    - Jam_Anon

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to clean up or prepare items in the living room, possibly involving throwing away items in the trash bin and using cooking tools like the wooden spoon and jam for food-related tasks.

      probability: 0.45
    - object: Pestel
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: WhiteTrashBin
      reason: "The WhiteTrashBin has the highest focus (45 counts) and proximity consistency (46 counts), making it highly likely the user intends to interact with it, especially given its functionality in discarding items."
    - object: Pestel
      reason: "The Pestel meets the distance and proximity thresholds (0.727 meters and 50 counts respectively) and shows significant recent focus (22 counts), suggesting the user is considering using it in their task."
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: "The WoodenSpoon has a strong focus count (38 counts) and proximity (48 counts). Although it does not meet the time threshold, the high focus and proximity indicate it remains a probable object for interaction."

    - WhiteTrashBin
    - Pestel
    - WoodenSpoon

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to clean up or prepare items in the living room setting, potentially involving cooking or organizing, as indicated by the focus on the trash bin and cooking utensils.

      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteTrashBin
      reason: "The WhiteTrashBin has the highest focus (45 counts) and proximity (46 counts) with an approach time of 0.84 seconds, clearly satisfying all thresholds, making it the top candidate for interaction."
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: "The WoodenSpoon shows considerable focus (38 counts) and proximity (48 counts) while also having a reasonable approach time (3.14 seconds), making it a strong second candidate despite a longer approach time."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "Although the Jam_Anon has slightly lower focus (25 counts) and proximity (49 counts), its relatively shorter approach time (9.67 seconds) still keeps it in contention as a probable interaction object."

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to cleaning up or preparing food, as they are focusing on kitchen-related items and waste disposal.
2024-10-17 11:26:29,654 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: Pestel
      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteTrashBin
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Pestel
      reason: The Pestel has a high proximity consistency count (50) and meets the time threshold (1.925 seconds). It is also among the highest in focus consistency (22 counts), making it highly probable for interaction in the current context.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The Wooden Spoon shows significant focus consistency (38 counts) and is also close (1.028 meters) to the user, which implies a strong likelihood of interaction even though it slightly misses the time threshold.
    - object: WhiteTrashBin
      reason: While the WhiteTrashBin has a focus count of 45, indicating it was observed significantly, it consistently shows high proximity (46 counts). However, it barely meets the time threshold and has a slightly greater distance. Thus, it is still likely but not as probable as the other two objects.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Pestel
    - WoodenSpoon
    - WhiteTrashBin

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or handle food, as indicated by their interaction with kitchen tools and utensils. The presence of objects like the Pestel and WoodenSpoon further suggests that they may be in the process of cooking or mixing ingredients.
