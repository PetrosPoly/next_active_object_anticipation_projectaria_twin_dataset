2024-10-17 11:13:31,462 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.5
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.3
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: This object has the highest focus (39 counts) and a relatively close proximity (a distance of 1.883 meters and 10 proximity counts), combined with a quick approach time (1.764 seconds). This makes it a highly probable candidate for interaction.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard previously appeared multiple times in the user's focus, which indicates sustained interest. Although it does not appear in the current proximity counts, its historical presence in previous predictions suggests it is important for the user's task.
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has been noted in prior predictions and interactions, showcasing it has significant focus history, even if it doesn't meet the time threshold now. This indicates it may still be relevant to the task at hand, thus it remains a probable interaction target.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackBarStool_B
    - ChoppingBoard
    - KitchenKnife

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food or engaging in some food-related activity, as indicated by their recurring focus on kitchen tools and items.
