    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      probability: 0.38
    - object: DinoToy
      probability: 0.32
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.30

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: "The BlackCeramicDishSmall has the highest count (65) in the high focus list, indicating that the user observed it intensively for a significant amount of time, suggesting a likely intention to interact."
    - object: DinoToy
      reason: "The DinoToy also has a substantial presence in both the high focus (63) and nearby (36) counts, indicating that the user may want to interact with it, especially given its appeal as a toy."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 has a high focus count (63) and is likely a common object of interest for media interaction, raising its probability of interaction as the user may be planning to watch something."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicDishSmall
    - DinoToy
    - DvdRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is to engage with specific objects in the living room, potentially related to cleaning, arranging, or entertainment, as indicated by the presence of the dish and remote control.

      probability: 0.36
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.26

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: "The BlackCeramicDishSmall has the highest count (65) in the high_focus_objects list, indicating that the user has spent the most time observing it, suggesting a strong intent to interact."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 has a relatively high count (63) in the high_focus_objects list and is likely associated with user activity related to TV, suggesting a potential interaction."
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "The TvRemote_1 also has a count of 63, indicating significant focus. The user may need to prepare for watching or changing channels, pointing towards a likelihood of interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicDishSmall
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare for some TV interaction or set up a viewing area, possibly by arranging items around the BlackCeramicDishSmall, which may suggest food or snacks while watching TV.

      probability: 0.32
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.30

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: "This object has the highest focus count (65) and a significant nearby presence (39), indicating the user has been observing it closely and staying near it, suggesting a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "With a focus count of 63 and also being a high count among nearby objects, the user may be preparing to control a device, likely a TV or DVD player, indicating the remote is likely a next target for interaction."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "Although it has a slightly lower focus count (62), the high rate of observation suggests the user is interested, possibly for placing objects or serving food, making it a probable point of interaction."

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare for an activity that involves using the TV or DVD player, potentially to watch something, and they might be setting up some food or items in the BlackCeramicDishSmall and BlackCeramicBowl.

      reason: "This object has the highest focus count (65), indicating that the user observed it intensively for a significant portion of time, suggesting a strong intention to interact."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "With a focus count of 63, this object is also highly observed, likely indicating that the user intends to engage with it, especially if they are planning to use the DVD player."
    - object: DinoToy
      reason: "Although the DinoToy has a similar focus count of 63, its presence in the nearby list (36) suggests that the user may be considering interacting with it but may not have focused on it as intensely as the other two."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicDishSmall

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list, I assume that the goal of the user is to interact with items in the living room, possibly to organize or use the remote for entertainment, while also considering the DinoToy as part of their focus.
