    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "CakeMocha_A has a decent focus count of 40, alongside a proximity count indicating the user has been nearby (91 counts for proximity). Although it has a longer time to approach (approximately 12 seconds), the focus level suggests it remains a candidate for interaction despite less favorable distance metrics."

rationale:
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: The CandleDishSmall has high focus consistency (41 counts), proximity counts (55 counts), and an excellent time to approach (1.96 seconds), making it highly probable that the user intends to interact with it.
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: The Tomato_A has a focus count of 49, is relatively close (1.13 meters), and has an approach time of 3.36 seconds. While it slightly exceeds the time threshold, its high focus count supports the likelihood of it being sought for interaction.
    - object: CakeMocha_A

    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: This object meets all three thresholds (focus, distance, time). It has high focus consistency (41 counts), is within close proximity (0.962 meters), and has an estimated approach time of only 1.96 seconds, making it the most likely object for interaction.
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: The Tomato_A satisfies the distance and time thresholds, with a low distance (1.131 meters) and a reasonable approach time (3.36 seconds), but its focus counts are slightly lower (49 counts) which suggests that while it is not the prime candidate, it is still quite probable for interaction.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: This object has a high focus count (40 counts) and is within a reasonable distance (1.075 meters), although it has a longer approach time (12.09 seconds). The favorable focus and proximity suggest that while it may not be the first choice, it remains likely for interaction.

    - object: Flask
      reason: The Flask has high proximity (91 counts) and is relatively close (1.175m). Although the focus count (54) is significant, the time to approach (about 6 seconds) does not meet the threshold. However, its proximity and past interactions indicate it might still be interacted with soon.

    - object: Flask
      reason: The Flask also shows high proximity consistency (91 counts) and a moderately high focus count (54 counts) with a distance of 1.175 meters and an approach time of 5.95 seconds. Although it doesn't meet the time threshold, it ranks high due to strong proximity and focus.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a focus count of 18 and is close (0.866 meters) with an approach time of 7.27 seconds. It meets the distance and focus counts but does not meet the time threshold; however, the focus count supports its relevance in the interaction prediction.
