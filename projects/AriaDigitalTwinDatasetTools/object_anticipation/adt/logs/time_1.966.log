    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.30
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus consistency count of 51 and is within a close distance of 0.982 meters. It also has a reasonable time to approach of approximately 3.5 seconds, indicating strong likelihood for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock shows a decent focus count of 17 and is also in close proximity at 1.062 meters. However, it doesn't meet the focus threshold as strongly as the CoffeeCanisterLarge, which makes it less likely to be interacted with. It has a longer time to approach, at about 6 seconds, slightly reducing its probability as well.
    - object: None
      reason: No other objects in the environment meet the minimum thresholds set for focus, distance, and time, making it unlikely that the user will interact with anything else.

    - object: null
      probability: 0.0

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has a high focus count of 51 and proximity consistency of 60, which indicates significant attention from the user. Additionally, the distance is below the threshold, and the estimated time to approach is only 3.5 seconds, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock exhibits a focus count of 17 and proximity consistency of 60, which shows that while it has less focus compared to the CoffeeCanisterLarge, it is still a point of interest. It is slightly less likely than the CoffeeCanister because the focus count is lower, but it remains an option due to its consistent proximity and reasonable approach time.

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus consistency (51 counts) and proximity consistency (60 counts), indicating the user has been observing and staying near it consistently. Additionally, it meets both distance (0.982 meters) and time (3.503 seconds) thresholds, making it the most likely object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has good focus counts (17 counts) and proximity counts (60 counts), but it falls short on focus consistency against the established thresholds. It is still likely to be interacted with due to its proximity and the fact that it is within an approachable distance (1.062 meters) in under 6 seconds.
    - object: None
      reason: While there are no additional specific objects mentioned, the next probable category includes other nearby objects that may attract attention or be of interest based on proximity and lesser focus counts. This category acknowledges potential interaction with unspecified items within the vicinity.

    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus count (51) and proximity count (60), indicating that the user has consistently focused on it and remained close, suggesting a high likelihood of interaction. Additionally, the estimated time to approach it (3.5 seconds) is below the threshold, making it even more probable for the user to engage with it.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a significant focus count (17) and proximity count (60), but its focus count is below the focus threshold. However, it still meets the proximity and time conditions, meaning the user is likely to interact with it, albeit with a lower probability than the CoffeeCanisterLarge.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other objects that meet the criteria sufficiently to warrant consideration. The next potential candidate would fall below the satisfaction of any thresholds, so it is marked as less likely.

      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus count (51), a high proximity count (60), and the shortest time to approach (3.5 seconds). This suggests that the user is closely engaged with this object and likely intends to interact with it soon, fulfilling all thresholds effectively.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock, while it has a decent focus count (17) and proximity count (60), takes longer to approach (5.9 seconds), which places it lower than the CoffeeCanisterLarge. It meets the distance and proximity thresholds but shows partial focus.
    - object: None
      reason: Since there are no other objects in the vicinity that meet all thresholds and considering the only two available options, this category accounts for any other potential objects the user might interact with in the environment, but is currently less likely based on the context.
