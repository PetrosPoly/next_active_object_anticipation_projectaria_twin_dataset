    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.55
    - object: WoodenBowl
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus count (91), indicating that the user has been paying significant attention to it. Additionally, the proximity count (15) and the estimated time to approach (1.81 seconds) both meet the specified thresholds, making it the most likely object for interaction.
    - object: WoodenBowl
      reason: The WoodenBowl has a decent focus count (66) and is relatively close to the user (1.968 meters). While it does not meet the time threshold (2 seconds), it satisfies the distance threshold and exhibits partial focus, making it the second most likely object for potential interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: With no other objects in the vicinity that meet the criteria, the "None" option represents the likelihood that no other interaction is expected, still maintaining a small probability to account for nearby or unaccounted objects.

    - ChoppingBoard
    - WoodenBowl
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or perform a cooking-related task, focusing on the ChoppingBoard for cutting or chopping, followed by utilizing the WoodenBowl for mixing or holding ingredients.

      probability: 0.55
    - object: WoodenBowl
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency count (91) and is within a distance of 1.769 meters, which is well within the proximity threshold. It also has a calculated time to approach of about 1.81 seconds, which meets the time requirement, making it the most likely object for interaction.
    - object: WoodenBowl
      reason: The WoodenBowl has a focus consistency count of 66, which, while lower than the ChoppingBoard, still indicates significant observation. It is slightly further away at 1.968 meters and has a time to approach of approximately 2.39 seconds, which exceeds our time threshold. Therefore, it is still a likely candidate for interaction, though less probable than the ChoppingBoard.
    - object: None
      reason: Since there are no other objects that meet the criteria, this placeholder reflects that other objects do not sufficiently meet the focus, distance, or time thresholds.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - WoodenBowl

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or processing food, as indicated by their focus on kitchenware such as the ChoppingBoard and WoodenBowl.

      probability: 0.55
    - object: WoodenBowl
      probability: 0.30
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency (91 counts) and is within a reasonable proximity (1.769 meters) allowing for a quick approach time (1.81 seconds). This suggests a strong likelihood of interaction.
    - object: WoodenBowl
      reason: The WoodenBowl has considerable focus consistency (66 counts) as well, but slightly lower than the ChoppingBoard, and is slightly further away (1.968 meters). However, the focus and proximity are still strong enough to suggest a probable interaction.
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: Although this object did not meet the time threshold for approach and has lower focus counts, it has been noted in past predictions, indicating it may still hold relevance to the user’s current task.

    - ChoppingBoard
    - WoodenBowl

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to food preparation or cooking activities, as indicated by their frequent focus on kitchenware such as the ChoppingBoard and WoodenBowl, as well as the CoffeeCanister, which may imply the user is preparing to make a beverage or meal.

    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus count (91) and is within the proximity threshold. Its estimated approach time is also under the acceptable limit, making it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: WoodenBowl
      reason: The WoodenBowl has a solid focus count (66) and is also within proximity but shows slightly less focus than the ChoppingBoard. However, it still meets the distance and time criteria, placing it as the next likely object for interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: This object was part of past predictions and has not been directly focused on recently, but its presence in the user's previous interactions suggests it might still be relevant, albeit with a lower probability because it does not meet the current time threshold.

    - ChoppingBoard
    - WoodenBowl
    - WhiteUtensilTray

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food, as both the ChoppingBoard and WoodenBowl are typical kitchen items used in food preparation and cooking tasks.

    - object: WoodenBowl
      probability: 0.3
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has a high focus consistency count of 91, indicating that the user has been observing it intensively. It also has a proximity count that suggests the user is close enough (1.769 meters away), making it highly probable for interaction as it meets the distance and focus criteria.
    - object: WoodenBowl
      reason: The WoodenBowl shows strong focus consistency with a count of 66 but has slightly fewer proximity counts (2), along with a distance of 1.968 meters. While it doesn't have the same level of focus as the ChoppingBoard, it still indicates a likelihood of interaction.
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The previous predictions included the CoffeeCanisterLarge, indicating past interest from the user. Although it doesn’t currently meet the time threshold, its presence in past observations suggests the user might still consider it for interaction, even if it is less likely compared to the primary targets.
