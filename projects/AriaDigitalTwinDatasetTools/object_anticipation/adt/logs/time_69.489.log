      probability: 0.37
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.33
    - object: Cereal_Anon
      probability: 0.30

rationale:
    - object: Apartment_CabinetDrawerA
      reason: "This object recorded the highest count in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts at 61, indicating significant user attention. Cabinets often store items that users frequently access, supporting the likelihood of user interaction."
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "The MuffinPan has a high count of 91 in the nearby_objects_measured_in_counts, suggesting the user spent considerable time close to it, which may imply intent to use it for baking tasks."
    - object: Cereal_Anon
      reason: "Cereal_Anon was observed frequently (count of 76) as well and could be an item the user is considering for breakfast or meal preparation, adding to its probability of interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Apartment_CabinetDrawerA
    - MuffinPan
    - Cereal_Anon

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare a meal or snack, possibly involving retrieving ingredients or tools from the cabinets, specifically baking-related items like the MuffinPan.
