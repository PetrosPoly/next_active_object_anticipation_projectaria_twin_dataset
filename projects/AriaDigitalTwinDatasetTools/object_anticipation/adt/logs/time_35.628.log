    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: Mango_A has the highest focus count (91) and also the shortest distance (0.909 meters) from the user. It meets both the focus and distance thresholds and has a significant time to approach of approximately 0.94 seconds, indicating high likelihood of interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a focus count of 68 and a proximity count of 89. While it has a longer time to approach (1.12 seconds), it still satisfies the distance threshold (1.101 meters). This makes it a strong candidate for interaction, following the Mango_A.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: CakeMocha_A has a focus count of 82 and a distance of 1.080 meters. While it slightly exceeds the time threshold with 1.495 seconds, it still satisfies the focus and distance criteria, allowing for its inclusion as a probable interaction object.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Mango_A
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - CakeMocha_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare or serve food, possibly involving fruits (Mango_A) and items like the BlackCeramicBowl for serving or mixing, along with a dessert or side dish (CakeMocha_A).

      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A has the highest focus consistency count (91), is the closest object (0.909 meters), and requires the least time to approach (0.94 seconds), making it the most probable candidate for interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a strong focus count (68), is within an acceptable distance (1.101 meters), and has a moderate approach time (1.12 seconds), placing it as the second most likely object for interaction based on the given criteria.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: The CakeMocha_A shows a high focus count (82), is also at a reasonable distance (1.08 meters), and requires a little more time to approach (1.5 seconds), making it a probable choice for interaction as well.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or consuming food items, possibly involving fruit and dessert items, as indicated by the focus on edible objects in the living room context.
