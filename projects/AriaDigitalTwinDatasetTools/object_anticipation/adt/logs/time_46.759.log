2024-10-17 11:12:02,381 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: BlackArmChair
      probability: 0.5
    - object: Donut_B
      probability: 0.3
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: BlackArmChair
      reason: The BlackArmChair has the highest focus consistency count (25) and a proximity consistency count (9), while also being close to the user (1.897 meters). Although it slightly exceeds the time threshold for approach (3.136 seconds), its strong focus indicates that the user is likely to engage with it next, possibly to sit down or relax.
    - object: Donut_B
      reason: Donut_B has a focus consistency count of 13 and proximity consistency of 10, and is only 1.769 meters away, meeting the distance threshold. Its focus consistency and higher proximity duration suggest that the user is actively considering interacting with it, likely to grab a snack.
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: Although the CoffeeCanisterLarge is not currently in the user's focus and has lower proximity counts, it appears in past predictions multiple times. This indicates it has been a relevant object in the user's previous interactions, suggesting a potential interest in it despite the current context.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackArmChair
    - Donut_B
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to find a comfortable space to sit and relax, possibly while enjoying a snack or beverage.
