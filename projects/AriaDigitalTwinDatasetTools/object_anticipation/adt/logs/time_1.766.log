      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus consistency (51 counts), is the closest object (0.994 meters), and has a short time to approach (1.91 seconds), fulfilling all thresholds. This indicates a high likelihood of interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock, while having a lower focus consistency (17 counts), is in close proximity (1.086 meters) and still meets the distance threshold with an estimated approach time of approximately 4 seconds. This interacts somewhat with focus counts and therefore ranks next in probability.

      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has significantly high counts in both focus (51 counts) and proximity (54 counts) while also having a distance under 1 meter. This suggests that the user is likely to interact with it soon, especially given that it meets the time threshold (1.91 seconds).
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a good focus count (17) and proximity count (54), but while it does meet the distance threshold, it does not meet the time threshold (3.97 seconds).

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or consume a beverage, as indicated by the focus on the CoffeeCanisterLarge, which might contain coffee or related items. The presence of the RedClock may also suggest that the user is mindful of time, possibly coordinating their beverage preparation with a schedule.

      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus count (51) and proximity count (54), as well as an acceptable distance (0.994 meters) and a quick approach time (1.91 seconds). This indicates a strong likelihood that the user will interact with it.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock exhibits good proximity counts (54) and a focus count (17). Although it has lower focus counts than the CoffeeCanisterLarge, it is still within a close range (1.086 meters) and has a longer time to approach (3.97 seconds), making it a plausible candidate for interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: No other objects are presented as viable candidates based on the provided data. The other options either exceed the time threshold without sufficient focus or proximity.

    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object exceeds the focus threshold with a total of 51 counts, has consistent proximity (54 counts), and a short approach time of 1.91 seconds. These factors indicate a high likelihood of interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although the RedClock shows considerable focus (17 counts) and consistent proximity (54 counts), it does not meet the time threshold effectively (3.97 seconds needed to approach). However, it remains a probable object for interaction because it is still fairly close and has been observed.
    - object: None
      reason: This predicts that there are no other significant objects meeting the minimal thresholds, reinforcing our focus on the two primary objects.

    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus and proximity counts, indicating that the user has been observing and staying close to it. It also has a favorable estimated time to approach, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock is the second most likely object as it has high proximity counts and some focus counts. Although it has a slightly lower probability due to lower interaction likelihood, it still fulfills the distance and focus criteria prominently.
    - object: None
      reason: While no third object has been noted as highly probable to interact with, considering that the user is focused on the two objects suggests that other objects in the immediate vicinity are less relevant to the current task.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to be preparing a beverage or organizing items in the living room, potentially related to a coffee-making task given the focus on the CoffeeCanisterLarge.

      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has a high focus count (51) and proximity count (54), exceeding the focus threshold of 30, indicating that the user has been observing and is likely to interact with it. Its current distance from the user (0.994 meters) and the low time to approach (1.911 seconds) also suggest that interaction is imminent.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a sufficient focus count (17) but slightly lower than the desired threshold. However, it does meet the distance (1.086 meters) and time thresholds, which makes it a probable object for interaction, albeit with lower priority compared to the CoffeeCanisterLarge.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other objects that meet the thresholds sufficiently to be predicted as candidates for interaction. As such, this slot accommodates the understanding that the user might not interact with additional objects based on available data.

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus and proximity counts, indicating strong likelihood of interaction. Its distance is under 1 meter and it has a good approach time of approximately 1.91 seconds, which meets all the criteria.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: While the RedClock has good proximity and focus counts, its approach time is longer at nearly 4 seconds. Despite this, it still meets the proximity threshold and has significant focus, positioning it as the second most likely object.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other candidates meeting the thresholds adequately. Both objects identified are the only significant focus points, with no alternative object fulfilling the criteria.

    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a solid focus count (17) and a similar proximity count (54), which implies that while it is not the main focus, it has been closely observed. Its time to approach is also under the threshold, indicating that interaction is possible, albeit less likely than the CoffeeCanisterLarge.
