      probability: 0.4
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Mortar
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "It has the highest count in the high focus list, suggesting the user has been observing it intensively, indicating a strong likelihood to interact with it, possibly for spreading or using in a recipe."
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "Although it is also present in both the high focus and nearby counts, it has substantial attention indicating that the user might want to use it for baking or preparing snacks."
    - object: Mortar
      reason: "It shows a significant level of focus and proximity, suggesting the user may need it for food preparation tasks involving grinding or mixing."

    - Jam_Anon
    - MuffinPan
    - Mortar

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare a dish or snack, possibly involving spreading jam or using the muffin pan for baking, supplemented with the ingredients that may require grinding or mixing.

    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "With the highest count (50) in high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts, Jam_Anon shows that the user has intensely observed it, suggesting a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "MuffinPan has a significant presence in both the high focus (48 counts) and nearby (32 counts) lists, indicating that the user is very likely to interact with it, especially if baking is the task."
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: "Though lower in focus (49 counts) and proximity (counts not specified but presence is strong), it remains a candidate for interaction due to its utility in organizing or serving items, making it relevant to the task the user is likely engaged in."

rationale:
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "Jam_Anon has the highest focus count (50) and doesn't fall below the proximity threshold. Slightly exceeding the time threshold suggests a high likelihood of interaction."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "BlackCeramicMug meets the focus count threshold (43) and is within an acceptable distance. While it slightly exceeds the time threshold, the combination of proximity and focus suggests the user may want to use it soon."
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: "WhiteFlatwareTray shows consistent focus (49 count) and is within proximity. Although it does not meet the time threshold, the userâ€™s attention indicates possible upcoming interaction."

    - object: Mortar
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "Jam_Anon has the highest focus consistency with 50 counts, which is well above the threshold of 45, and its distance of 1.792 meters is within acceptable proximity. Additionally, the time to approach is 2.619 seconds, which, while slightly exceeding the 2-second threshold, is still manageable given the high focus and proximity."
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: "WhiteFlatwareTray has a focus consistency of 49 counts and a distance of 1.921 meters, satisfying the focus threshold and being close to the distance threshold. Its time to approach is 2.723 seconds, just exceeding the acceptable time limit, making it a strong candidate for interaction based on proximity and focus."
    - object: Mortar
      reason: "Mortar shows a good focus consistency of 47 counts and a distance of 1.582 meters, both of which meet the required thresholds. Although the approach time is also above the threshold at 2.298 seconds, the combined factors of focus and proximity suggest it remains a probable interaction."

rationale:
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "Jam_Anon has the highest focus consistency (50 counts), indicating significant attention from the user. Although it does not fully meet the distance threshold, it has a relatively close proximity (1.792 meters) and requires a longer time to approach (2.619 seconds), suggesting the user is likely to interact with it shortly."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "BlackCeramicMug meets the focus threshold (43 counts) and relatively close proximity (1.603 meters). Its time to approach (2.171 seconds) is above the threshold, but it is still a probable candidate due to good focus interaction."
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: "MuffinPan has the focus count of 48, indicating that it captures the user's attention significantly. While it is also near the distance threshold (1.456 meters), the time to approach (1.960 seconds) falls below the threshold. However, its focus suggests a possible upcoming interaction."

rationale:
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "Jam_Anon has the highest focus count at 50, indicating sustained attention. While it doesn't strictly meet the distance and time thresholds, its significant proximity and high focus suggest it's a priority item for the user."
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: "WhiteFlatwareTray has a consistent focus count of 49 and is within a close distance threshold, giving it a high probability of interaction even though it slightly exceeds the time threshold."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "BlackCeramicMug shows a solid focus count of 43 and is near the user, but it barely meets the time threshold. Its combination of focus and proximity keeps it relevant for interaction."
