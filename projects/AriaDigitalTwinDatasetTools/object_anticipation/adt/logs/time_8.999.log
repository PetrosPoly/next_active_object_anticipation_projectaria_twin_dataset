    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork has the highest focus consistency (81 counts) and is within a close distance (1.088 meters), along with a reasonable approach time (34.1 seconds). It is highly probable that the user is preparing to eat or serve food, indicating a strong likelihood of interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl also has a high focus consistency (72 counts) and is very close (1.131 meters) with a suitable approach time (3.34 seconds). Its proximity and focus suggest it may be used for serving or containing food, making it significantly likely for interaction.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: CakeMocha_A shows good focus consistency (80 counts) and is fairly proximate (1.355 meters). Despite a longer predicted approach time (26.3 seconds), the combination of focus and proximity retains its emergence as a probable interaction object, especially if the user is considering a dessert.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WoodenFork
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - CakeMocha_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or serving food, either for a meal or dessert, as indicated by the selection of utensils and containers nearby.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has high focus counts (72) and is within close proximity (1.131 meters) with a short time to approach (3.343 seconds). The combination of these factors suggests that the user is likely interested in this object for interactions related to its use, such as food preparation or serving.
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: While the WoodenFork has a focus count of 81, it has a longer time to approach (34.1 seconds) which raises concerns about immediate interaction intent. However, its proximity remains high, indicating that the user may need to use it soon or that it is just nearby while they focus on other objects.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: The CakeMocha_A has significant focus counts (80), moderate proximity (1.355 meters), and a longer approach time (26.3 seconds). The high focus on this object indicates a strong interest, likely related to it being a consumable item, although the distance and time suggest it might not be an immediate interaction.

    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - WoodenFork
    - CakeMocha_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or enjoying a meal or snack, potentially involving the use of the BlackCeramicBowl for serving and the WoodenFork for eating or cooking, as well as possibly preparing to enjoy the CakeMocha_A as a dessert.

    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork has the highest focus count (81) and is located relatively close to the user (1.088 meters). It also has a time to approach of 34.1 seconds, which is longer, yet its significant focus and proximity indicate it is a likely candidate for interaction, especially if the user is preparing food.
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: The Tomato_A shows a solid focus count (57), is within a reasonable distance (1.486 meters), and has a short time to approach (2.5 seconds). The combination of higher focus and proximity makes it very probable that the user will interact with this object next, likely related to food preparation.
    - object: BlackCeramicDishSmall
      reason: The BlackCeramicDishSmall has a good focus count (72) and is also within close distance (1.138 meters). While its time to approach (3.4 seconds) is not the shortest, the overall focus and proximity values position it as a strong candidate for the next interaction.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to food preparation or serving, as indicated by the focus on kitchen items like the WoodenFork and Tomato_A, as well as the presence of various dishes and bowls in the vicinity.

      probability: 0.35
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork has the highest focus count of 81, and a current distance of 1.088 meters, which is well within the acceptable range. Its time to approach is also 34.1 seconds, but the strong focus and proximity make it a primary candidate for interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a focus count of 72 and is close by with a distance of 1.131 meters. It also has a time to approach of about 3.3 seconds. Both focus and proximity are significant, suggesting that the user is likely to engage with it soon.
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: The CakeMocha_A has a focus count of 80, indicating strong interest, but its approach time is 26.3 seconds which slightly exceeds the preference threshold. Nonetheless, the other factors, especially focus, indicate that it remains a viable option for the userâ€™s task.
