      probability: 0.45
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "TvRemote_1 has the highest focus count (57), indicating the user has spent a significant amount of time observing it, suggesting an intention to interact, likely to control the television."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "DvdRemote_1 is the second highest with a focus count of 56, almost equal to TvRemote_1, indicating that the user may be considering using it possibly in conjunction with the television or for viewing a DVD."
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      reason: "BirdHouseToy has a decent focus count (49), suggesting it caught the userâ€™s attention enough to be considered for interaction, possibly for play or to move it."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - TvRemote_1
    - DvdRemote_1
    - BirdHouseToy

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is likely to engage with various electronic devices in the living room, particularly focusing on remote controls for entertainment purposes while considering casual interaction with toys.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "TvRemote_1 has the highest count (57) in the high_focus_objects list, indicating significant attention from the user. Given the context of a living room, it is likely the user wants to interact with the TV."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "DvdRemote_1 is the second most observed object with a count of 56, suggesting the user might also be interested in interacting with the DVD player, typically used alongside the TV."
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      reason: "BirdHouseToy has a notable count of 49, indicating it has drawn attention. This suggests the user might be interested in interacting with it, potentially for playful or decorative purposes."

    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "The TvRemote_1 has the highest count in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list, indicating that the user observed it intently and likely intends to interact with it to possibly watch TV."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 also shows significant presence in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list, suggesting that the user may want to watch a DVD, thereby increasing the likelihood of interaction."
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      reason: "While lower in focus intensity compared to the remotes, the BirdHouseToy has substantial counts, indicating it might attract the user's attention for a potential interaction, possibly for leisure or play, thus retaining some likelihood."

      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "The TvRemote_1 has the highest focus count of 57, indicating significant attention from the user. It is likely that the user intends to interact with it, perhaps to change the channel or adjust the volume."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 has a high focus count of 56, making it a strong candidate for interaction. The user may want to use it to play a DVD or manage content on the connected device."
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      reason: "Despite being somewhat lower in focus intensity with a count of 49, the BirdHouseToy is still noteworthy. Its presence in the high focus list suggests it might be a target for playful interaction, especially if the user has engaged with it previously."
