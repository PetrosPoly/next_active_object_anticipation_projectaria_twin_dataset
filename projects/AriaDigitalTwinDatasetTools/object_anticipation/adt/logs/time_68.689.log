2024-10-17 11:12:51,349 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.45
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: The DvdRemote_1 has the highest focus consistency count (78) and is in close proximity (1.804 meters) with a short time to approach (1.768 seconds), making it highly probable that the user intends to interact with it.
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: The TvRemote_1 also shows significant focus consistency (78) and is similarly close (1.848 meters), along with a reasonable time to approach (1.817 seconds), suggesting the user may want to interact with this object next.
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      reason: While the ToothbrushHolder has a slightly lower focus count (75), it still meets the distance (1.821 meters) and time thresholds (1.686 seconds), making it a probable candidate for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - ToothbrushHolder

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to engage with various electronic devices, possibly to watch a movie or show, and may involve looking for specific items in the living room for leisure or entertainment purposes.
