    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.35
    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      probability: 0.30
    - object: GreenApple_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug has a high focus count of 64 and is also nearby with a count of 52, indicating it has captured the user's intense attention and proximity, suggesting a strong likelihood for interaction."
    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      reason: "The NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon has a focus count of 64 which is substantial, and it is also nearby with a count of 47, making it a likely candidate for the user to interact with, especially in a living room setting."
    - object: GreenApple_A
      reason: "The GreenApple_A has a solid focus count of 58 and is present in a nearby count of 41, indicating that the user is considering engaging with this object, potentially for a snack or beverage."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
    - GreenApple_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is likely to prepare a drink or a snack, possibly involving the BlackCeramicMug for coffee and either the NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon or GreenApple_A as potential ingredients or items to consume.

      probability: 0.30
    - object: BambooPlate
      probability: 0.35

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug has a high count of 64 in the high_focus_objects list, indicating that the user observed it intensely. Additionally, it is among the nearby objects with significant observation counts, suggesting that they are likely to interact with it soon."
    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      reason: "The NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon has a count of 64 in the high_focus_objects list and also has a presence in nearby objects. Its high observation time suggests that the user is considering interacting with it."
    - object: BambooPlate
      reason: "The BambooPlate has a count of 58 in the high_focus_objects list and is also close enough to the user. Its presence in both high focus and nearby lists indicates enhanced likelihood of interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
    - BambooPlate

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare a beverage, likely involving the BlackCeramicMug and NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon, while possibly utilizing the BambooPlate for serving or holding items like snacks or fruits.
