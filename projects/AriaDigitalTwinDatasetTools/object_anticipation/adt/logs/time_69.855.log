    - object: CandlePattern03_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WoodenToothbrushHolder
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CandlePattern04_1
      reason: This object has a high focus consistency count (91), close proximity (1.463 m), and a reasonably low time to approach (1.443 seconds). It satisfies all thresholds, making it the most likely candidate for interaction.
    - object: CandlePattern03_1
      reason: Similar to CandlePattern04_1, this object also enjoys a strong focus consistency (91 counts) and proximity (1.492 m). It has a slightly lower predicted time of approach (1.453 seconds), confirming its high probability for interaction.
    - object: WoodenToothbrushHolder
      reason: This object is another strong contender with a focus count of 91. Although it has a slightly greater distance (1.685 m) and time to approach (1.698 seconds), its consistent focus suggests the user remains interested, placing it in a probable interaction category.

    - object: CandlePattern02_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CandlePattern04_1
      reason: This object has a high focus count of 91, is within the acceptable proximity range with a distance of 1.463 meters, and has an estimated approach time of 1.44 seconds. These factors indicate that the user is highly likely to interact with this object soon.
    - object: CandlePattern02_1
      reason: Similar to CandlePattern04_1, this object also has a high focus count of 91 and a close distance of 1.514 meters, with an approach time of 1.56 seconds. Its strong presence in the focus counts along with satisfying the distance threshold makes it a very probable candidate for interaction.
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      reason: Although it has a focus count of 91, which indicates strong user interest, it slightly lags behind in proximity with a distance of 1.518 meters. However, it still meets the focus and proximity criteria, making it a likely object for interaction.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or enjoying a gathering or meal, as evidenced by the interest in candles and crackers, which are often associated with a cozy or social setting.

    - object: CandlePattern04_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.30
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      probability: 0.35

rationale:
    - object: CandlePattern04_1
      reason: CandlePattern04_1 has the highest focus consistency count (91) and is within a reasonable distance (1.463 meters) and time to approach (1.442 seconds). This suggests a high likelihood of interaction as the user has shown consistent focus on this object, indicating it may be of particular interest.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: DvdRemote_1 also met the focus and proximity criteria with counts of 61 and a distance of 1.398 meters. Even though it has a higher time to approach (3.07 seconds), its consistent focus indicates that the user intends to interact with it, perhaps to play or pause a video.
    - object: ToothbrushHolder
      reason: ToothbrushHolder satisfies the focus (79) and proximity (43) counts, indicating some interest, although the time to approach (1.654 seconds) is slightly above the threshold. This shows that while the user's focus is not at the highest level, the proximity and the observed interest could still lead to potential interaction.

    - CandlePattern04_1
    - DvdRemote_1
    - ToothbrushHolder

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to engage with decorative items or manage audiovisual content in the living room, possibly preparing to watch a movie or show. The consistent focus on certain items suggests that the user might be looking to enhance the ambiance or functionality of the space.

rationale:
    - object: CandlePattern04_1
      reason: This object has a strong focus count of 91, a distance of 1.463 meters (which is well within the threshold), and an approach time of 1.442 seconds. It meets all three criteria, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: CandlePattern03_1
      reason: CandlePattern03_1 also has a high focus count of 91, a distance of 1.492 meters, and an approach time of 1.453 seconds. Like CandlePattern04_1, it satisfies all thresholds, supporting its high likelihood of interaction.
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: While DvdRemote_1 does not meet the time threshold (3.073 seconds), it has a focus count of 61 and a distance of 1.398 meters. It satisfies the focus and distance criteria, suggesting it remains a probable option for interaction, albeit with slightly less certainty than the first two objects.

    - CandlePattern04_1
    - CandlePattern03_1
    - DvdRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to engage with decorative items in the living room, possibly to set a pleasant ambiance or prepare the room for entertainment, as indicated by the interaction with the DvdRemote suggestive of media viewing.
