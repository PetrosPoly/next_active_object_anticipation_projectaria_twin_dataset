2024-10-17 11:26:35,812 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.4
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.35
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: It meets the distance threshold (1.040 meters), the time threshold (approximately 1.60 seconds to approach), and shows significant focus consistency (29 counts), making it highly probable that the user will interact with it.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: It also meets the distance threshold (1.103 meters), the time threshold (approximately 4.76 seconds to approach), and has a focus consistency of 36 counts, indicating that although the time to approach is longer, the focus suggests intent to interact.
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: Although it meets the distance threshold (1.091 meters) and has a high focus consistency (37 counts), it is slightly over the time threshold for interaction but is still probable due to its close proximity and significant observation counts.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - ChoppingBoard
    - KitchenKnife

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to food preparation, as they have shown interest in objects typically used for cooking and organizing food items, indicating a task that involves meal preparation or cooking activities.
