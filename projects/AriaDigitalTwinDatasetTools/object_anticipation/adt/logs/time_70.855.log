    - object: WoodenToothbrushHolder
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CandlePattern01_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenToothbrushHolder
      reason: The WoodenToothbrushHolder has high focus consistency (91 counts), a manageable distance (1.233 meters), and a quick approach time (0.903 seconds). It meets all thresholds, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      reason: Cracker_Anon has strong focus consistency (91 counts), is within a reasonable distance (1.141 meters), and has a very short approach time (0.587 seconds). It satisfies the focus and distance thresholds, enhancing its likelihood for interaction.
    - object: CandlePattern01_1
      reason: CandlePattern01_1 shows high focus consistency (91 counts) and meets the proximity threshold (1.197 meters) with a moderate approach time (0.976 seconds). Though it doesn't have quite as strong other metrics compared to the previous two, it still falls under probable for interaction.

    - CandlePattern01_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to engage in some form of item organization or selection within the living room environment, with potential prioritization for practical and decorative items, as indicated by the interaction focus on both functional (toothbrush holder) and aesthetic (candles) objects.

    - object: CandlePattern01_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WoodenToothbrushHolder
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      reason: Cracker_Anon has the highest focus count (91) and a very low time to approach (0.587 seconds), which indicates a strong likelihood of interaction. The distance is also within the acceptable range (1.141 meters), making it highly probable that the user will engage with this item.
    - object: CandlePattern01_1
      reason: CandlePattern01_1 also shows a strong focus count (91) and a reasonable time to approach (0.977 seconds), with a distance of 1.197 meters. This combination places it in a strong position for potential interaction based on focus and proximity.
    - object: WoodenToothbrushHolder
      reason: WoodenToothbrushHolder has a solid focus count (91) but a longer time to approach (0.903 seconds). While it is less immediate than the first two options, it is still favorable due to the high focus count and acceptable proximity (1.233 meters).

    - object: CandlePattern01_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WoodenToothbrushHolder
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      reason: Cracker_Anon has a high focus count (91) and the shortest time to approach (0.59 seconds), making it highly probable that the user is interested in this object for interaction.
    - object: CandlePattern01_1
      reason: CandlePattern01_1 meets both distance (1.197 meters) and time thresholds (0.98 seconds) and has a solid focus count (91), indicating significant attention from the user.
    - object: WoodenToothbrushHolder
      reason: WoodenToothbrushHolder has a strong focus count (91) and a brief approach time (0.90 seconds) but is slightly further away (1.233 meters) compared to the other two, which places it in the third position for probability.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely centered around organizing or interacting with miscellaneous items within the Living Room, possibly preparing for a leisure activity or setting up for a cozy environment, as indicated by the focus on nearby objects like snacks (Cracker_Anon) and decorative items (CandlePattern01_1).

    - object: CandlePattern01_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WoodenToothbrushHolder
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      reason: This object has the highest focus consistency (91 counts) and a relatively low distance (1.141 meters) along with a short time to approach (0.587 seconds), making it a prime candidate for interaction based on the given thresholds.
    - object: CandlePattern01_1
      reason: Although it doesn't have as high a focus consistency as Cracker_Anon, CandlePattern01_1 maintains a strong focus count (91 counts) and an equally favorable proximity (1.197 meters) with a reasonable time to approach (0.977 seconds), which keeps it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: WoodenToothbrushHolder
      reason: This object displays solid focus (91 counts) and is also within proximity (1.233 meters) with a decent time to approach (0.903 seconds). It meets the distance and focus criteria, making it likely to be interacted with, albeit slightly less so than the top two objects.
