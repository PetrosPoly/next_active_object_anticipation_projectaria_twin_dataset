2024-10-17 11:20:58,647 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: Pestel
      probability: 0.4
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Pestel
      reason: The Pestel has the highest focus count (37) and is within close proximity (1.809 meters). It also has an estimated approach time of 2.601 seconds, which is slightly above the threshold but still suggests that the user is likely to interact with it soon.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has a high focus count of 35 and is similarly close (1.706 meters). Its approach time is also below the threshold at 2.321 seconds, making it a probable candidate for interaction.
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: The BlackCeramicMug has a focus count of 30, which meets the focus threshold. It is slightly farther away (1.853 meters) and has a longer approach time of 2.661 seconds, but it still remains a likely choice due to the focus on it.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Pestel
    - MuffinPan
    - BlackCeramicMug

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or serve food, particularly involving the use of the Pestel and MuffinPan, potentially in relation to baking or food preparation tasks.
