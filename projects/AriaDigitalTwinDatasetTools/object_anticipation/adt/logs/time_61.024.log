    - object: Cereal_Anon
      probability: 0.5
    - object: DecorativeBoxHexSmall
      probability: 0.3
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: Cereal_Anon
      reason: "Cereal_Anon has the highest focus count (45), indicating the user has observed it intensely, suggesting a strong likelihood of interaction, possibly to eat or prepare cereal."
    - object: DecorativeBoxHexSmall
      reason: "With a nearby count of 44, this object has been in the user's vicinity for a significant amount of time, indicating potential interest, perhaps in exploring its contents."
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "DvdRemote_1 has appeared in earlier predictions, reflecting a consistent interest from the user; combined with its proximity, it suggests the user might want to interact with it to control the TV."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Cereal_Anon
    - DecorativeBoxHexSmall
    - DvdRemote_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is likely to prepare food, watch something on TV, or manage their space, as indicated by their focus on food-related items and remote controls.
