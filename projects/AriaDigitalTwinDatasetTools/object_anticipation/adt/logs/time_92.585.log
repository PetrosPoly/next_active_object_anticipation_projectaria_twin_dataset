      probability: 0.4
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard has high focus consistency (45 counts) and proximity consistency (34 counts), which exceeds both thresholds effectively. It is also close enough (1.614 meters) for easy access, making it the most likely object for interaction."
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: "The KitchenKnife has a strong focus consistency (45 counts) and a reasonable distance (1.590 meters), which satisfies both focus and proximity thresholds. It is likely that the user intends to use it in conjunction with the chopping board."
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "The CoffeeCanisterLarge meets both the distance (1.711 meters) and time (2.866 seconds) thresholds, along with reasonable focus consistency (30 counts). While its focus is slightly lower than others, it is still a probable object for interaction, probably related to preparing items on the ChoppingBoard."

      probability: 0.4
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard has a high focus consistency count of 45, which meets the focus threshold. Additionally, the distance of 1.614 meters and a time to approach of approximately 3.97 seconds suggests it is within a reasonable proximity for interaction, making it the most probable object for the user to engage with."
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: "The KitchenKnife also meets the focus threshold with a count of 45, as well as having a close distance of 1.590 meters, which implies it is within reach. The time to approach is about 3.98 seconds, indicating a likely interaction. It is thus a strong candidate for the user's next action."
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "The CoffeeCanisterLarge meets the distance threshold at 1.711 meters and has a time to approach of around 2.87 seconds, but its focus count is slightly lower at 30. This makes it probable as the user seems to be near it, even if the focus isn't as high as the top two objects."

      probability: 0.4
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus count of 45 and is within the proximity threshold, making it a highly probable candidate for interaction. This indicates the user has spent considerable time observing this object and is close enough to approach it easily."
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: "The KitchenKnife also meets the focus threshold with 45 counts and is relatively close at 1.590 meters. Although the time to approach is slightly above the threshold, the high focus count suggests the user is likely considering using it, especially in conjunction with the ChoppingBoard."
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "The CoffeeCanisterLarge meets both the focus threshold (30 counts) and is within the proximity threshold (1.711 meters). While it does not exceed the time threshold, its presence in the user's focus and proximity suggests a potential interaction."

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or a meal, given the focus on cooking-related objects such as the ChoppingBoard and KitchenKnife. The presence of items like the CoffeeCanisterLarge indicates a potential interest in preparing a beverage, aligning with typical kitchen activities.

      probability: 0.35
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "ChoppingBoard has the highest focus count (45) and proximity consistency count (34), indicating that the user has been focusing on it significantly and remains close to it. This suggests it is central to their current task."
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: "KitchenKnife also meets the focus threshold (45) and has a reasonable proximity count (35), combined with a short time to approach (approximately 4 seconds). This reinforces its likelihood of being directly involved in the user's task."
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "CoffeeCanisterLarge satisfies the distance and time thresholds but has lower focus counts (30). Although it has been observed less frequently, its proximity and reasonable approach time suggest it is still relevant to the user's activity."

      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard has high focus (45 counts), proximity (34 counts), and acceptable distance (1.614 meters), making it the most probable object for interaction as it satisfies all thresholds."
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: "The KitchenKnife displays strong focus (45 counts) and proximity (35 counts) with a distance of 1.590 meters, which meets both focus and proximity thresholds, placing it second in terms of likelihood for interaction."
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "The CoffeeCanisterLarge has a decent focus (30 counts) and proximity (23 counts) but is slightly further away (1.711 meters), hence it is still probable although it does not meet the time threshold."
