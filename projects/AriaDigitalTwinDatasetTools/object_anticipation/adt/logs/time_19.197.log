    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus count (67), satisfies the proximity and time thresholds, making it the most probable object for the user to interact with.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon has a strong focus count (63) and a reasonable proximity count (43) with a time to approach of approximately 1.07 seconds, making it a likely candidate despite not being the highest in focus.
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      reason: While the AirPurifier_1 has a decent focus count (49) and is within a close distance with a time to approach of 1.63 seconds, it ranks lower than the first two but remains probable given the conditions.

    - KitchenKnife
    - WoodenSpoon
    - AirPurifier_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food or cooking, as indicated by the presence of kitchen-related objects like the KitchenKnife and WoodenSpoon.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus count (67) and a close distance (0.981 meters), indicating that the user has consistently observed it and is very near to it. This combination makes it highly probable that the user intends to interact with the knife.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon also has a high focus count (63) and is within a reasonable distance (1.023 meters). Since it meets the focus and distance criteria, it is very likely the user will interact with it next.
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      reason: The AirPurifier_1, despite a lower focus count (49), has a moderate distance (1.206 meters). It may attract the userâ€™s attention due to its proximity, making it a possible object of interaction.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus consistency (67 counts) among all objects and is within a distance of approximately 1 meter. It also has a low time to approach, making it a strong candidate for interaction based on both focus and proximity.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon also has high focus consistency (63 counts) and is relatively close (1.023 meters). Its proximity and focus maintain it as a likely candidate, even though its time to approach is slightly higher than the KitchenKnife.
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      reason: Although the AirPurifier_1 has lower focus counts (49) compared to the top two, it is still within a reasonable distance (1.206 meters) and has a decent time to approach. This makes it a probable option, especially considering it may be a part of the user's task in the living room environment.

      probability: 0.45
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has the highest focus (67 counts) and is within close proximity (0.981 meters). It also has a time to approach (1.009 seconds) below the threshold. These factors clearly indicate it is the most likely object for the user to interact with.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon has a high focus count (63 counts) and is also close to the user (1.023 meters) with an acceptable time to approach (1.072 seconds). It meets the focus and distance thresholds, making it a strong candidate for interaction.
    - object: AirPurifier_1
      reason: The AirPurifier_1 has a focus count of 49, which is just below the focus threshold, but it is close (1.206 meters) and approachable in under 2 seconds (1.631 seconds). While it may not qualify as highly probable, it remains a possible interaction based on its metrics.
