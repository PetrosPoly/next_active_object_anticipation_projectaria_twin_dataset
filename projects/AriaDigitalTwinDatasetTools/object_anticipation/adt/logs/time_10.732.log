2024-10-17 11:20:59,463 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: Pestel
      probability: 0.4
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Pestel
      reason: The Pestel has the highest focus count (29) and is within a close distance (1.953 meters) with a relatively quick approach time (4.25 seconds). This makes it a strong candidate for interaction as the user is highly focused on it.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has a solid focus count (27) and is also within close proximity (1.856 meters) but has a longer estimated approach time (3.44 seconds). Its additional usage in cooking suggests it is likely to be interacted with soon.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: Although BlackBarStool_B has a slightly lower focus count (22), it is in close proximity (1.868 meters) and has a reasonable approach time (1.85 seconds). It is a viable option as the user might need to use a stool for preparation or to reach other items.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Pestel
    - MuffinPan
    - BlackBarStool_B

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare food or snacks, possibly involving baking or cooking, as indicated by their focus on kitchen-related objects like the Pestel and MuffinPan.
