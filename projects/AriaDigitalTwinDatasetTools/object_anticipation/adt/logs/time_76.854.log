      probability: 0.30
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      reason: "This object has the highest count in the nearby list (63) and is also in the high focus list (63), indicating that the user spent significant time observing it closely while being nearby."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "This object has a strong presence both in the high focus (64) and nearby (61) counts, suggesting the user is likely considering interacting with it, possibly for a drink."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "Although it has a lower focus count (61), it is still prominent in the nearby list and might be relevant to an activity such as preparing food or a snack which the user likely needs."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - Jam_Anon

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare a snack or drink, likely involving coffee or tea with accompanying items such as jam, potentially for a light meal or refreshment in the Living Room.

    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug has one of the highest observation counts (64) and is among the quick access objects, making it likely the user intends to interact with it for a drink or snack."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "Jam_Anon has a high focus count (61) and is also observed significantly when nearby, indicating it might be being considered for pairing with food or drink."
    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      reason: "Despite slightly lower focus counts (63), NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon is often nearby and has demonstrated significant presence in the user's vicinity, indicating potential interaction possibly for a coffee preparation."

    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      probability: 0.30
    - object: GreenApple_A
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug has the highest count in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list, indicating significant attention from the user. Additionally, it has a high presence in the 'nearby_objects_measured_in_counts', suggesting the user has been in close proximity, increasing the likelihood of interaction."
    - object: NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
      reason: "The NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon also has a high count in both lists, indicating not only that the user has observed it frequently but has also spent considerable time nearby. This dual presence makes it a strong candidate for interaction."
    - object: GreenApple_A
      reason: "The GreenApple_A has a notable count in both lists, suggesting that the user has been attentive and has remained nearby, which implies a strong probability of interaction to satisfy a potential desire for a snack or to incorporate it into a task."

    - BlackCeramicMug
    - NIT_CoffeeCan_Anon
    - GreenApple_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare for a potential drink or snack in the living room setting, possibly getting a coffee or snack before continuing with another activity.
