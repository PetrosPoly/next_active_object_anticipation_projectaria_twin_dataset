    - object: BambooPlate
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BambooPlate
      reason: The BambooPlate has the highest focus count (91), is in close proximity (0.884 meters), and has a low time to approach (1.513 seconds). These factors align perfectly with all thresholds, making it the most likely object for interaction.
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: Jam_Anon has a high focus count (89) and is also consistently nearby (1.337 meters), with a reasonable approach time (2.944 seconds). It meets the focus and proximity criteria, indicating it is likely to be next in the user's interactions.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: MuffinPan has a decent focus count (81), proximity (1.215 meters), and time to approach (2.974 seconds). Although it's not the highest in focus, it still meets the distance and time thresholds, making it a probable object for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BambooPlate
    - Jam_Anon
    - MuffinPan

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing a meal or serving food, potentially involving the use of the BambooPlate for presentation, Jam_Anon for flavor, and MuffinPan for baking or serving items like muffins.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BambooPlate
      reason: BambooPlate shows a high focus count (91) and the shortest distance (0.884 meters) with a reasonable approach time of 1.51 seconds. This combined data strongly indicates that the user is likely to interact with it soon.
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: Jam_Anon also has a significant focus count (89) and is within a reasonable distance (1.337 meters) with a short approach time of 2.94 seconds, suggesting that it is a likely candidate for interaction based on the user's behavior.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: MuffinPan has a commendable focus count (81) and is close as well (1.215 meters), with a decent approach time (2.97 seconds). Though it is slightly lower in focus compared to the first two objects, it remains a probable option for interaction.

    - BambooPlate
    - Jam_Anon
    - MuffinPan

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare a dish or snack that involves using the plate for serving and the jam possibly for topping or mixing, along with baking or presenting items in the muffin pan.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BambooPlate
      reason: This object has the highest focus consistency count (91), is close to the user at a distance of 0.884 meters, and has the shortest time to approach (1.513 seconds). This strong combination of focus, proximity, and low time to approach suggests that the user is very likely to interact with it.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon has a high focus consistency count (60), is close to the user at a distance of 1.230 meters, and requires 2.64 seconds to approach. Although it slightly falls under the ideal time threshold, it still holds significant focus and proximity indicating a probable interaction.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard also meets the proximity threshold (1.077 meters) and has a good focus consistency count (73). Although its time to approach (3.39 seconds) exceeds the threshold, the combination of other positive metrics gives it a reasonable chance of interaction.

    - BambooPlate
    - WoodenSpoon
    - ChoppingBoard

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely centered around food preparation or meal assembly, as evidenced by the consistent interaction with kitchen utensils and cooking supplies.

      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BambooPlate
      reason: The BambooPlate has the highest focus count (91), is the closest object at 0.884 meters, and has a relatively short time to approach (1.51 seconds), indicating a high likelihood for interaction.
    - object: WoodenSpoon
      reason: The WoodenSpoon also has a strong focus count (60), a favorable distance of 1.230 meters, and a reasonable time to approach (2.64 seconds). This combination positions it as a probable candidate for interaction.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has a solid focus count (81), is 1.215 meters away, and requires 2.97 seconds to approach, satisfying the focus and proximity thresholds, thus making it likely for the user to interact with it.
