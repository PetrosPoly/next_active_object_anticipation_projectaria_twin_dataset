    - object: WhiteChair
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteChair
      reason: "The WhiteChair has the highest count (91) in the nearby_objects_measured_in_counts list, indicating the user spent significant time close to it, suggesting a strong potential for interaction."
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug is among the high_focus_objects with a count of 49. This suggests the user has observed it with considerable intensity, highlighting interest for potential use."
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: "The Jam_Anon has a count of 50 in the high_focus_objects list. Additionally, it is nearby, indicating it may be a target for interaction, likely indicating a potential task related to eating or making a snack."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WhiteChair
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - Jam_Anon

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is likely related to preparing a snack or drink while seated, potentially involving the use of the chair and the jam, paired with the mug for a beverage.
