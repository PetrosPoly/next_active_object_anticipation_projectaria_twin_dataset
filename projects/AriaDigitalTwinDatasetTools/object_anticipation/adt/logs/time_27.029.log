2024-10-17 11:26:26,107 - INFO - LLM Response: most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.30
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.35

rationale:
    - object: KitchenKnife
      reason: The KitchenKnife has a high focus count of 63 and is among the closest objects with a distance of 1.088 meters. It also has a quicker approach time of 1.88 seconds, making it very probable for interaction as it satisfies the focus and approaching time metrics significantly.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has a high focus count of 33 and a proximity count showing it is likely to be engaged with, along with a reasonable distance of 1.119 meters. The time to approach it (1.91 seconds) means it meets both proximity and time criteria.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: While the MuffinPan shows a substantial focus count of 83, its distance of 0.887 meters and time to approach of 1.63 seconds indicate it is easily within reach. It suggests that the user might be engaged in preparing something requiring this object.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - KitchenKnife
    - ChoppingBoard
    - MuffinPan

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing food, as suggested by the interaction with cooking-related tools like the KitchenKnife, ChoppingBoard, and MuffinPan. The user's past behavior also indicates a focus on various kitchen tools, supporting this goal.
