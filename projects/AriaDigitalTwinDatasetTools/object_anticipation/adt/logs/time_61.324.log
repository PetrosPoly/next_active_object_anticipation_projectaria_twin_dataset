    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.4
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask has the highest focus count (48) and is within close proximity (1.194 meters), with a relatively short approach time (12.65 seconds). This indicates that the user is likely observing the Flask closely and is prepared to interact with it."
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: "The CandleDishSmall shows a significant focus count (35) and is positioned within a close distance (0.988 meters) with an approach time of approximately 4.82 seconds. This makes it probable for interaction, especially given its high proximity count."
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "Tomato_A has a moderate focus count (43) and reasonable proximity (1.158 meters). Although it doesn't quite meet the time threshold of interaction, the combination of its counts in focus and proximity suggests that the user may still want to engage with it."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - Flask
    - CandleDishSmall
    - Tomato_A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare or serve food, likely involving the Flask for a beverage and the Tomato_A as a fresh ingredient. The interest in the CandleDishSmall may relate to setting an atmosphere or aesthetic during the food preparation process.

    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask has high focus (48 counts), high proximity (91 counts), and an acceptable approach time (12.65 seconds), making it the most probable object for interaction."
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "CakeMocha_A shows significant focus (46 counts), good proximity (91 counts), but a longer approach time (50.92 seconds), positioning it as a probable choice for interaction."
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: "CandleDishSmall has moderate focus (35 counts), decent proximity (49 counts), and a quick approach time (4.82 seconds), making it a less likely but still possible object for interaction."

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or consuming a beverage and dessert, possibly involving serving or presenting items in the living room environment.

    - object: CandleDishSmall
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Flask
      reason: "The Flask has a high focus count (48) and is also within a close distance (1.194 meters), along with a reasonable time to approach (12.645 seconds). This meets the necessary thresholds of focus and distance, making it the most likely object for interaction."
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: "The CandleDishSmall has a focus count of 35, which is just below the focus threshold, but it is also nearby (0.988 meters) and the time to approach is very short (4.818 seconds), allowing it to satisfy the distance and time requirements."
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "Although the Tomato_A has a slightly lower focus count (43) and a greater distance (1.158 meters), it is still within proximity and has a relatively quick approach time (7.851 seconds). Thus, it remains a probable object for user interaction."

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or serving food or drinks, suggesting they may be engaged in an activity such as setting the table, cooking, or arranging a dining experience in the living room.
