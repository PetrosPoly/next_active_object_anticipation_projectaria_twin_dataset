    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.30
    - object: GreySofa
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 has a high focus count of 63, indicating the user spent a significant amount of time observing this object, which suggests a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "Similar to the DvdRemote_1, the TvRemote_1 has a focus count of 65, reflecting the user's intention to interact. The proximity counts also indicate the user was near the TV remote for a considerable duration."
    - object: GreySofa
      reason: "The GreySofa has a focus count of 62 and is among the high focus objects. Although its count is slightly lower than the remotes, the likelihood of the user interacting with it is still strong, potentially for comfort or observation."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - GreySofa

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is likely to engage with the TV and its remote controls for possible viewing, indicating a desire to enjoy entertainment or relax in the living room. The surrounding context and high focus on the sofa also imply the user may want to settle down while interacting with these objects.

      probability: 0.45
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: GreySofa
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "DvdRemote_1 has a high focus count of 63, indicating that the user has been observing this object attentively, suggesting a strong intention to interact with it."
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "TvRemote_1 closely follows with a focus count of 65, which also indicates the user has been paying significant attention to it, making it likely they want to engage with it next."
    - object: GreySofa
      reason: "GreySofa has a high focus count of 62 and is likely an object of interest for the user as they may want to sit down while interacting with the remotes which are used for the TV or DVD player."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - GreySofa

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is to relax in the living room, likely by watching a DVD or TV program, given the high focus on the remotes and their proximity to seating options.

    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.4
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "The DvdRemote_1 has the highest count of 63 in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list, indicating significant attention and a likelihood of interaction as the user may want to watch a DVD or play something."
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "Following closely, the TvRemote_1 has a count of 65 in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list and is also highly observed. This suggests that the user might want to interact with the TV, possibly to change the channel or adjust the volume."
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      reason: "Though it has a lower count of 62 in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts, it remains a nearby observable item indicating that the user may be interacting with it as an activity or for playful engagement."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - BirdHouseToy

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is to enjoy some entertainment, likely by watching a movie or television show, and possibly interacting with the BirdHouseToy for leisure or decorative purposes.

    - object: DvdRemote_1
      probability: 0.38
    - object: TvRemote_1
      probability: 0.36
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      probability: 0.26

rationale:
    - object: DvdRemote_1
      reason: "With a significant count of 63 in high_focus_objects and a nearby count of 85, the DvdRemote_1 has been observed intensively, indicating the user is likely interested in manipulating the DVD player. The high emphasis on this object suggests a strong intention to interact."
    - object: TvRemote_1
      reason: "The TvRemote_1 holds a close count of 65 in high_focus_objects and 87 in nearby counts, indicating that the user may want to control the TV. Given the high counts for both intensity and proximity, it is a strong candidate for interaction."
    - object: BirdHouseToy
      reason: "Though its counts are slightly lower (62 in high_focus and 91 nearby), the BirdHouseToy has retained considerable attention. It may imply a playful interaction or a response to another recent prior interaction, making it a viable choice."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - DvdRemote_1
    - TvRemote_1
    - BirdHouseToy

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is likely to engage with media (such as watching a movie or adjusting settings) in the living room environment, possibly while also considering playful interactions with the BirdHouseToy.
