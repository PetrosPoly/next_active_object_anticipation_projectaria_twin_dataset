      probability: 0.4
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Tomato_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "CakeMocha_A has the highest focus count of 45, exceeds the distance and time thresholds, making it the prime candidate for interaction."
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: "CandleDishSmall has a focus count of 36, is close (0.984 meters), and can be approached in 3.85 seconds, fitting well within the distance and time thresholds."
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "Tomato_A has a focus count of 44, is relatively close (1.155 meters), and can be reached in approximately 6.35 seconds. Although it slightly surpasses the time threshold, its focus and proximity make it a likely candidate."

      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "CakeMocha_A has the highest focus count of 45, is within a favorable distance at 1.072 meters, and the approach time is moderately acceptable at 33.3 seconds. This suggests that the user is highly likely to interact with this object, likely driven by a desire for a treat or dessert."
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: "BlackCeramicBowl has a focus count of 18, is close at a distance of 0.871 meters, and the time to approach is 8.75 seconds. Although it does not meet the focus threshold, its proximity and reasonable time indicate prominent interest, making it a probable candidate for interaction."
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: "CandleDishSmall has a focus count of 36 and a distance of 0.984 meters with a quick approach time of approximately 3.86 seconds. Despite a slightly lower focus count, its proximity and the time suggest the user may be considering lighting this candle, hence making it a likely interaction point."

    - CakeMocha_A
    - BlackCeramicBowl
    - CandleDishSmall

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare or enjoy a specific type of food or drink, possibly involving a combination of snacks or beverages, given the focus on dessert items and kitchenware.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: Flask
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "CakeMocha_A has the highest focus count (45) and is within close proximity (1.072 meters), with an appropriate time to approach (33.34 seconds). Even though it doesn't meet the time threshold, its high focus and proximity suggest that the user is likely to interact with it soon."
    - object: Flask
      reason: "Flask shows a strong focus count (49) and is quite close (1.191 meters), with a reasonable time to approach (10.46 seconds). It meets both the focus and distance thresholds, indicating a likely interaction since the user has spent a lot of time observing it."
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: "CandleDishSmall satisfies the proximity (0.984 meters) and time thresholds (3.86 seconds) while having a focus count of 36, making it a probable object for interaction as the user has shown consistent engagement with it."

    - CakeMocha_A
    - Flask
    - CandleDishSmall

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the "previous_predictions" list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or enjoy a treat, possibly involving the CakeMocha_A, while also utilizing the Flask for drink preparation, and perhaps enhancing the ambiance with the CandleDishSmall.
