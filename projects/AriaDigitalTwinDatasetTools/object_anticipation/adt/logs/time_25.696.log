    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Pestel
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Mortar
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has the highest focus count of 91 and a close distance of 0.939 meters, plus a low time to approach of 1.925 seconds. These factors indicate that the user has been intently observing and is positioned to interact with it very soon.
    - object: Pestel
      reason: The Pestel shows a high focus count of 79 and is at a distance of 0.838 meters with an approach time of approximately 1.938 seconds. These metrics suggest that although it has slightly less focus than the MuffinPan, it is still highly probable that the user intends to use it next.
    - object: Mortar
      reason: The Mortar has a high focus count of 84 and a short distance of 0.930 meters, alongside a time to approach of 1.897 seconds. It scored well in both focus and distance, positioning it as a likely candidate for interaction, though slightly less probable than the first two objects due to lower focus.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - MuffinPan
    - Pestel
    - Mortar

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or cook a specific dish or baked item, which involves utilizing kitchenware and tools such as pans, utensils, and possibly pestles for ingredient preparation.

    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Mortar
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has a high focus count (91) and proximity count (65), indicating that the user has been observing it a lot and has spent significant time near it. The estimated time to approach (1.93 seconds) is also under the threshold, marking it as a highly probable candidate for interaction.
    - object: Mortar
      reason: The Mortar shows strong focus (84) and proximity (60) counts, along with a short estimated approaching time (1.9 seconds). While it does not have as high a focus count as the MuffinPan, the combination of factors makes it a solid second choice for interaction.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard possesses a good focus count (59) and a high proximity count (70), combined with a time to approach that meets the threshold (2.88 seconds). Even though the focus is relatively less compared to MuffinPan, its proximity and reasonable time ahead of interaction make it a probable choice.

    - MuffinPan
    - Mortar
    - ChoppingBoard

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to food preparation or cooking activities, possibly involving baking, given the emphasis on kitchenware like muffin pans and chopping boards.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Mortar
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has the highest focus consistency count (91) and is close to the user (0.939 meters), which suggests it is highly probable the user will interact with it for their task, likely involving food preparation or cooking.
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: Jam_Anon also has a high focus count (83) and is within a reasonable proximity (1.108 meters). The combination of sustained focus and accessible distance indicates it is a strong candidate for interaction, likely related to food or snacks.
    - object: Mortar
      reason: The Mortar shows a decent focus (84) and is the closest object (0.930 meters). However, while it doesn't match the time threshold, its proximity and high focus counts keep it plausible for the user's interaction based on previous behaviors.

    - MuffinPan
    - Jam_Anon
    - Mortar

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely centered around cooking or preparing food, given the focus on kitchen-related items and tools.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: The MuffinPan has the highest focus consistency count (91) and is closely followed by a reasonable proximity count (65). It also has a short time to approach (approximately 1.93 seconds), making it a prime candidate for interaction as it meets all the key thresholds for selection.
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: Jam_Anon has strong focus consistency (83) and a decent proximity count (52), while also having a time to approach of approximately 2.63 seconds. It meets the threshold of focus and time, suggesting the user is likely to interact with it next, especially after observing it and being near it frequently.
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: ChoppingBoard has a solid focus consistency (59) and proximity (70) but just meets the time threshold (around 2.89 seconds). While not as overwhelmingly probable as the first two, its visibility in the user's focus and proximity makes it a plausible next object for interaction.

    - MuffinPan
    - Jam_Anon
    - ChoppingBoard

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to food preparation, perhaps baking or assembling a meal, given the focus on kitchen-related items such as the MuffinPan and Jam_Anon, alongside the ChoppingBoard, which is commonly used for food preparation tasks.
