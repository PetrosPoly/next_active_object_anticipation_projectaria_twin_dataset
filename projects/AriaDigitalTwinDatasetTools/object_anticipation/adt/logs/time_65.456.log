    - object: CandlePattern03_2
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteVaseSmall_2
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: GreenApple_A
      reason: "The user has a high count of 91 for the GreenApple_A in the nearby_objects_measured_in_counts, indicating significant time spent close to it, suggesting a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: CandlePattern03_2
      reason: "The CandlePattern03_2 has a high focus count of 67, indicating that the user focused on this object intensively, along with a moderately high nearby count, suggesting it's likely they want to interact with it."
    - object: WhiteVaseSmall_2
      reason: "While WhiteVaseSmall_2 has a focus count of 65, it's slightly lower than the others, but it remains a contender due to its placement in the high focus list, indicating it caught the user's attention."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - GreenApple_A
    - CandlePattern03_2
    - WhiteVaseSmall_2

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare or interact with food items (such as the GreenApple_A) while possibly arranging or showcasing decorative items (like the CandlePattern03_2 and WhiteVaseSmall_2).

      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteVaseMedium_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Plant2_4
      reason: "Plant2_4 has the highest count (85) in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list, indicating strong attention and a likely intention to interact with it."
    - object: CandlePattern03_2
      reason: "CandlePattern03_2 has a high count (67) as well, suggesting that the user has observed it extensively, making it a strong candidate for interaction."
    - object: WhiteVaseMedium_1
      reason: "WhiteVaseMedium_1 also has a significant count (57) showing that it has drawn attention, although slightly less than the top two, it remains a potential candidate for interaction."

    - object: DisplayUnit_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Plant2_4
      reason: "With the highest count of 85 in high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts, the user has shown significant attention towards Plant2_4, indicating a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: CandlePattern03_2
      reason: "CandlePattern03_2 has a count of 67, one of the higher counts, which suggests it has been in the user's focus for a considerable time, making it likely to be interacted with next."
    - object: DisplayUnit_1
      reason: "Though DisplayUnit_1 has a count of 74, it ranks slightly lower than the top two choices. It shows consistent attention but may not be as immediate as the previous two, still indicating a higher probability of interaction."
