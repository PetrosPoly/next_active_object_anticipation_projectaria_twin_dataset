    - object: WoodenBowl
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenBowl
      reason: "The WoodenBowl has a high focus count of 85, a proximity count of 62, and a short approach time of 0.64 seconds, making it the most probable object for interaction."
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: "The Mango_A displays a good balance with a focus count of 84, proximity count of 51, and a very quick approach time of 1.07 seconds, indicating it is likely to be interacted with."
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "While the CakeMocha_A has lower focus and proximity counts compared to the top two, it still has significant focus (76 counts) and a reasonable approach time of 1.52 seconds, making it a plausible option."

    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenBowl
      reason: "The WoodenBowl has the highest proximity consistency and low time to approach, indicating the user is likely to interact with it soon. The count of 85 in focus reinforces this likelihood."
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: "The Mango_A has a high focus count of 84 and an impressive proximity score, paired with a short time to approach of 1.072 seconds, making it highly probable for interaction."
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "With a focus count of 76, a reasonable proximity count, and a time to approach of 1.518 seconds, the CakeMocha_A is a likely candidate for interaction, especially since food items often draw user attention."

    - object: CakeMocha_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WoodenBowl
      reason: "The WoodenBowl has very high focus (85 counts) and a short distance (0.870 meters), and it requires only 0.640 seconds to approach, meeting all thresholds for interaction."
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: "The Mango_A has a strong focus count (84 counts) and is in close proximity (0.980 meters) with a quick approach time (1.072 seconds), satisfying both distance and focus criteria."
    - object: CakeMocha_A
      reason: "The CakeMocha_A has significant focus (76 counts) and is within proximity, although slightly longer approach time (1.518 seconds) keeps it likely, meeting the criteria for focus and proximity."
