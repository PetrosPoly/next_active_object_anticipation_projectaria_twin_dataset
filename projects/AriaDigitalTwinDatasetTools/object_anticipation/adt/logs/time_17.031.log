      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: Tomato_A
      reason: "Tomato_A has the highest count of 38 in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list, indicating that the user observed it intensely for a significant duration. Additionally, it also has high proximity counts, suggesting the user has been close to it for a prolonged time, implying a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: WhiteVase
      reason: "WhiteVase has the second-highest focus count at 36, indicating significant observation. It appears in both the high-focus and nearby objects lists, suggesting the user has focused on it and been close to it, increasing the chances of interaction."
    - object: CandleDishSmall
      reason: "CandleDishSmall has a count of 31 in the high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts list and a higher nearby count of 59, indicating the user has spent considerable time nearby it. Although its focus count is lower than that of Tomato_A and WhiteVase, the high proximity count still suggests a reasonable likelihood for interaction."
