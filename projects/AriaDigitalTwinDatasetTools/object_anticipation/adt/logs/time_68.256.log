    - object: CoffeeCanisterSmall
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      probability: 0.30
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.35

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterSmall
      reason: "The CoffeeCanisterSmall has the highest count in the high_focus_objects list (73 counts), indicating it has received the most attention from the user, suggesting a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      reason: "Cracker_Anon has a significant presence in both high_focus_objects (50 counts) and nearby_objects (71 counts), suggesting that the user has been close to it for an extended duration, increasing the chance of interaction."
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: "The WhiteUtensilTray has a high focus count (58 counts) and is also nearby, representing a potential interactive object based on its significant attention from the user."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterSmall
    - Cracker_Anon
    - WhiteUtensilTray

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is likely to prepare a snack or meal, potentially involving coffee and crackers, and may need utensils for serving or eating. This aligns with the observations of the coffee canisters and food-related items in the vicinity.

    - object: CoffeeCanisterSmall
      probability: 0.37
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      probability: 0.33
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.30

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterSmall
      reason: "This object has the highest count in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list (73), indicating that the user has observed it intensely for a significant amount of time, suggesting a strong interest in interacting with it."
    - object: Cracker_Anon
      reason: "This object has a high count (50) in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list and has the highest count (71) in the 'nearby_objects_measured_in_counts' list, indicating that the user was likely near it for a longer duration, which enhances its probability for interaction."
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "While it has a lower focus count (65) than CoffeeCanisterSmall, it still ranks high in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list and is reasonably close enough to suggest likelihood of interaction, especially considering it is a related object to the CoffeeCanisterSmall."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterSmall
    - Cracker_Anon
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is likely related to preparing or serving a snack, possibly involving beverages and snacks, given the focus on coffee canisters and crackers.
