    - object: BookDeepLearning
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BookBoxSmall_2
      probability: 0.35
    - object: StepLadder_1
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: BookDeepLearning
      reason: "This object has the highest count in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list (80), indicating the user has looked at it intensively, suggesting a strong intention to interact with it."
    - object: BookBoxSmall_2
      reason: "This object also has a significant count (77) in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list, making it a likely candidate for interaction based on the user's focused interest."
    - object: StepLadder_1
      reason: "Despite being slightly lower in the 'high_focus_objects_measured_in_counts' list (73), this object is practical for tasks requiring elevation, and has a good count in the 'nearby_objects_measured_in_counts' list, suggesting the user may have needed time close to it."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BookDeepLearning
    - BookBoxSmall_2
    - StepLadder_1

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is likely to engage with books related to deep learning or fiction, possibly organizing or retrieving them, and they may need the step ladder for accessing higher shelves in relation to their task.

    - object: BookDeepLearning
      probability: 0.30
    - object: BookFiction9_01
      probability: 0.32

rationale:
    - object: BookComic1_01
      reason: "This book has the highest focus count (91) indicating strong interest from the user. Its presence in the nearby objects list further indicates that the user may consider it for interaction, likely looking to read or handle it."
    - object: BookDeepLearning
      reason: "With a high focus count of 80 and a nearby count of 91, this object shows considerable attention and proximity, suggesting that the user might want to access this book for learning or reference purposes."
    - object: BookFiction9_01
      reason: "This fictional book has a significant presence in both focus (78) and nearby counts, indicating it is also a candidate for interaction, possibly for leisure reading."

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to read or gather information from specific books within the living room, particularly focusing on comic and deep learning materials, while also considering some fiction books for leisure reading.
