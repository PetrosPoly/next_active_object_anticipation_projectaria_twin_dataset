    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      probability: 0.4
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: The WhiteFlatwareTray has a high focus consistency count of 85 and proximity consistency count of 91. It also has a very short approach time of 1.16 seconds, which suggests that the user is highly likely to interact with this object next.
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: The Jam_Anon shows significant focus consistency with a count of 49 and proximity count of 91, with a reasonable approach time of 7.35 seconds. This combination makes it a probable candidate for interaction, especially given its proximity.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: Although the MuffinPan has a lower focus count of 27, it maintains a strong proximity count of 91 and an approach time of 9.97 seconds. While it doesn't meet the time threshold perfectly, the combination of proximity and focus signals that it could still be a potential interaction target.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: MuffinPan
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: Jam_Anon has the highest focus count (49) and is within close proximity (0.751 meters). This indicates that the user is likely considering it for interaction, particularly in a context related to food preparation or serving.
    - object: MuffinPan
      reason: MuffinPan has a strong proximity count (91) and focus count (27), suggesting prolonged interest and closeness. Its relevance would align with possible baking or cooking activities.
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: WhiteFlatwareTray shows significant proximity (91) and a decent focus count (85), which indicates that while thereâ€™s a high potential for interaction, it may be slightly less prioritized than the other two objects. It may be involved in serving or arranging food.

      probability: 0.4
    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BambooPlate
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: The WhiteFlatwareTray has a high focus count (85) and very close proximity (0.780 meters), making it highly probable that the user intends to interact with it. It also meets the distance and focus thresholds, solidifying its highest probability.
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: Jam_Anon displays strong focus (49) and proximity (0.751 meters) counts, indicating the user is highly attentive to it and is close enough to interact. It also meets the distance and focus criteria, contributing to its strong likelihood of interaction.
    - object: BambooPlate
      reason: While BambooPlate has slightly lower focus (49) compared to the others, it maintains good proximity (1.076 meters) and is quick to approach (approximately 2.29 seconds). This makes it a viable candidate for interaction, fulfilling the focus and distance requirements despite not meeting the time threshold.

    - object: Jam_Anon
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BambooPlate
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteFlatwareTray
      reason: The WhiteFlatwareTray has consistently high focus and proximity counts. It is within close distance (2.053 meters) and has a focus count of 85. Additionally, the time to approach is very low (1.158 seconds), making it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: Jam_Anon
      reason: Jam_Anon has the highest focus count (49) and was also observed closely (91 in proximity counts) indicating substantial interest. Though its distance is manageable (0.751 meters), it fails the time threshold but remains a strong candidate for interaction due to its high focus.
    - object: BambooPlate
      reason: BambooPlate shows decent focus (49) and proximity counts (91) while also being at a reasonable distance (1.076 meters). It meets the focus and proximity criteria although it slightly falls short on the time threshold, suggesting a likelihood of interaction due to its placement in the user's environment.
