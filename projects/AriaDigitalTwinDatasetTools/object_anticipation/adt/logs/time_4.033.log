      probability: 0.25
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus count (88), and while it is slightly farther away than BlackBarStool_B, it is within the proximity threshold and has a lower time to approach, indicating a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: "The BlackBarStool_B has a good focus count (28) and a strong proximity count (40), with a relatively short time to approach as well. It meets the distance and time thresholds, making it the next most likely object for interaction."
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "The CoffeeCanisterLarge was mentioned in past predictions, showing it may be relevant to the user's goal. Despite not meeting time thresholds, it has substantial focus and proximity counts making it a probable candidate for interaction."

    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency (88 counts) and is near the user, making it the most likely object for interaction. Its proximity also suggests that the user may be preparing to use it."
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: "BlackBarStool_B has a significant focus count (28) and is fairly close to the user. Although it does not meet the focus threshold, its proximity and the time required to approach are conducive to possible interaction."
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "CoffeeCanisterLarge appeared in past predictions but currently does not meet the time threshold for approach. However, given the user's past interest, it remains a potential interaction target."

      probability: 0.35
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "ChoppingBoard has the highest focus count (88), indicating the user has observed it the most, which suggests a strong intention to interact with it. It is also within an appropriate distance (1.949 meters) and with a low approach time of 2.871 seconds."
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: "BlackBarStool_B has a decent focus count (28) and is close to the user (1.807 meters). However, it doesn't meet the focus threshold but still has good proximity and a reasonable approach time. It remains probable for interaction."
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "CoffeeCanisterLarge was among the past observed objects, suggesting potential relevance. Although it has no current focus and proximity counts, previous engagement indicates that it may still be an object of interest, hence the lowest probability."

    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: "BlackBarStool_B has a significant focus count (28) and a manageable distance (1.807 meters), although its focus count is below the threshold. Its quick time to approach (3.43 seconds) suggests that interaction is possible."
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "CoffeeCanisterLarge appears in past predictions and is likely relevant to the user's current task. However, it does not have focus or proximity data in the current context, making it a less probable choice."

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency (88 counts) and is also close enough (1.949 meters) for interaction. The user remains in proximity to the ChoppingBoard, contributing to its high probability."
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: "The BlackBarStool_B shows significant focus (28 counts), is within an approachable distance (1.807 meters), and although the focus count is lower than required, the proximity counts are substantial enough to suggest possible intent to interact."
    - object: None
      reason: "While not an object, predicting 'None' indicates that the user may not be looking to interact with any specific object right now. It acknowledges potential distractions or changes in user intent, albeit with lower probability."

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: "The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency (88 counts) and proximity consistency (5 counts), indicating that the user is paying close attention and is relatively near. Though it barely meets the distance threshold, the significant focus suggests a strong likelihood of interaction."
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: "The BlackBarStool_B shows notable focus (28 counts) and proximity consistency (40 counts). While it does not fully meet the focus and distance thresholds, the reasonable proximity makes it a possible interaction object as the user may be preparing to sit."
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: "The CoffeeCanisterLarge was included in past predictions, indicating a consistent interest. However, it falls slightly short on focus and proximity counts in the context of the current environment, making it less likely than the top two but still probable due to its past presence in user interactions."
