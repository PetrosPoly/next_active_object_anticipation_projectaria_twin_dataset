    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      probability: 0.45
    - object: ExtendableTable
      probability: 0.35
    - object: WhiteChair
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: BlackCeramicMug
      reason: "The BlackCeramicMug has the highest focus count of 45, indicating the user has been intensely observing it for a significant portion of time. This suggests a strong intention to interact with it, possibly to drink or place something inside."
    - object: ExtendableTable
      reason: "The ExtendableTable has a strong focus count of 51. Given that it is likely related to a task such as setting up a meal or organizing items, it remains a prominent object of interest for the user."
    - object: WhiteChair
      reason: "With a focus count of 91 and being a nearby object, the WhiteChair represents a potential interaction site, likely for the user to sit down, possibly in conjunction with another task involving the table or mug."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - BlackCeramicMug
    - ExtendableTable
    - WhiteChair

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions), I assume that the goal of the user is to prepare for a meal or beverage, which may involve sitting down at the table with the mug, suggesting a need for comfort and functionality in the living space.

    - object: WhiteChair
      probability: 0.4
    - object: BlackTablet
      probability: 0.35
    - object: ExtendableTable
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: WhiteChair
      reason: "The WhiteChair has the highest observed focus counts (91) indicating it received significant attention from the user, suggesting it is likely to be interacted with, possibly for seating."
    - object: BlackTablet
      reason: "The BlackTablet has a high focus count (37) and is also present in the previous predictions; this indicates it may have relevance to the user's task, further increasing the likelihood of interaction."
    - object: ExtendableTable
      reason: "The ExtendableTable has a significant focus count (51) and could be used for setting items or for organization within the userâ€™s task, making it a relevant object to consider for interaction."

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - WhiteChair
    - BlackTablet
    - ExtendableTable

goal_of_the_user: Based on current predictions and the past ones from the list (previous_predictions) I assume that the goal of the user is likely to arrange or utilize the seating and surfaces in the living room, possibly preparing for an activity that involves sitting down with items like the BlackTablet or engaging with tasks related to the ExtendableTable.
