      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has a high focus count of 90 and is the closest object with a distance of 1.026 meters, while the approach time is just 0.79 seconds. It clearly stands out as a highly probable object for interaction due to its critical role in food preparation.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A has a focus count of 91 which indicates strong user attention, and it is relatively close at 1.067 meters, making it likely that the user is interested in interacting with it. The approach time of about 1.48 seconds also supports this prediction.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has a focus count of 91, indicating significant attention, but it is slightly further away at 1.229 meters compared to the others. However, it meets the thresholds satisfactorily and is still likely to be interacted with due to its contextual importance in the user's task, possibly food-related.

    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.35
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency count (90), and it is also the closest object with a distance of 1.026 meters, requiring only about 0.79 seconds to approach. This suggests it is very likely to be the next object the user intends to interact with, especially if they are preparing food.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A has a strong focus count (91) and a relatively short distance of 1.067 meters, with a time to approach of 1.48 seconds. This indicates a high degree of probable interaction as the user seems to be interested in it while being physically close by.
    - object: BlackCeramicBowl
      reason: The BlackCeramicBowl has significant focus consistency (91) and is at a distance of 1.229 meters, with a time to approach of 1.94 seconds. While it doesn't have the same proximity as the ChoppingBoard or Mango_A, the sustained attention on this object suggests it may also be relevant to the task at hand.

    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: This object also exhibits significant focus and proximity consistency. It meets the distance and time thresholds and has a slightly lower but still considerable focus count, indicating the user may be preparing to interact with it next.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although it has high focus and proximity counts, it fails to meet the time threshold for approach. However, it remains in the user's focus, which suggests potential interest, making it less likely but still a candidate for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - WhiteUtensilTray
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is to prepare or serve something potentially related to food or drink, as indicated by the focus on the coffee canister and utensil tray. The presence of the clock may indicate a concern for timing related to this task.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.4
    - object: None
      probability: 0.0

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has the highest counts for both focus and proximity, indicating that the user has been observing and staying near it a lot. Additionally, it meets the time threshold for approaching, making it the most likely object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock does not meet the time threshold to approach, but it has significant focus and proximity counts. This suggests that while the user has been attentive to it, the current proximity may not lead to immediate action, hence it is likely to be the second object of interest.

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions, it can be inferred that the user's goal is likely related to obtaining or using something from the CoffeeCanisterLarge, possibly getting coffee or some other item, and checking the time on the RedClock. The consistent focus on both objects implies they are essential to the user's current activity in the Living Room.

    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.5
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.3
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge meets both the distance threshold (1.033 meters is well within 15 meters) and the time threshold (2.4 seconds is less than 3 seconds). Additionally, it has a high focus consistency count (31), indicating that the user has been observing this object closely, making it the most probable choice for interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The WhiteUtensilTray also meets the distance threshold (1.004 meters) and has a high focus consistency (31 counts). While it does not meet the time threshold, its close proximity and significant focus suggest that the user is likely to interact with it next.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a focus consistency (17 counts) and is at a proximity of 1.072 meters. However, it does not meet the time threshold of 3 seconds (114 seconds) but remains a possibility due to its comparatively high focus count.

      probability: 0.55
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.30
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus and proximity counts, indicating a sustained interest from the user. Additionally, it meets the time threshold for approaching, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has good focus counts, but its approach time is slightly longer. Although it doesn't meet the time threshold as strictly as the CoffeeCanisterLarge, its substantial focus on it suggests it is still a likely candidate for interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: No other object meets the attention or interaction criteria; hence this reflects a lower interest level or lack of viable alternatives for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions, the user is likely attempting to prepare or consume a beverage, indicated by their focus on the CoffeeCanisterLarge, while keeping track of the time via the RedClock.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.55
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus (50 counts) and proximity (50 counts) consistency from the user, indicating that it is a key object they are likely to interact with. Additionally, it has a short time to approach (2.86 seconds), which is under the 3-second threshold, making it the most probable choice.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a decent focus (17 counts) and proximity (50 counts) consistency. While its focus counts are lower, it meets the distance and time thresholds indicating that while it may not be the primary object of focus, the user is still likely to consider it for interaction given its proximity and the reasonable time to approach (7.27 seconds).
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other objects meeting the necessary cumulative thresholds for prediction, so this slot recognizes that the user may not currently have a third object for interaction in mind.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to retrieve or utilize coffee, involving interaction primarily with the CoffeeCanisterLarge, while also keeping an eye on the time (RedClock) to manage their activities effectively.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge satisfies the distance (1.015 meters) and the time (2.86 seconds) thresholds, making it highly probable for interaction. With the highest focus count (50 counts), it shows that the user has observed this object significantly, which enhances its likelihood of being selected for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock meets the proximity threshold (1.108 meters) and has a considerable focus count (17 counts). However, it fails to meet the time threshold but remains relevant due to consistent proximity and some focus, thereby being deemed the second most likely object.
    - object: None
      reason: As there are no other objects in the environment that meet the defined thresholds, this option is included to ensure the total probability adds up to 1. 

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.45
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.35
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.20

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has the highest focus and proximity counts, indicating that the user has been intensely observing and staying close to it. The time to approach is well below the threshold, suggesting it's very likely the user will interact with it soon, possibly to make a coffee.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: Similar to the CoffeeCanisterLarge, the WhiteUtensilTray has strong focus and proximity counts. While it does not have a high time to approach, the user frequently focuses on it, indicating a likelihood of interaction, potentially for picking up utensils.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although the RedClock meets the focus and proximity counts, its time to approach is too high. It has somewhat less focus and proximity consistency compared to the other two objects. Hence, while still a possibility, it is the least likely to be interacted with in comparison.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - WhiteUtensilTray
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and the focus on kitchen-related objects, it can be inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare a beverage or snack, which typically involves retrieving items from the kitchen space.

      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency (87 counts) and is the nearest object, making it the most likely for interaction. It also falls within the proximity threshold, suggesting the user is likely to interact with it soon.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: The BlackBarStool_B has a lower focus consistency (28 counts) but is nearby and has a moderately low distance. It satisfies the distance and time criteria, indicating the user might consider it next, albeit with less intensity compared to the ChoppingBoard.
    - object: None
      reason: Given that there are only two objects actively being focused on, and the thresholds for time are not met for extra objects, 'None' is included to reflect that there are no other objects currently considered relevant for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or engage in a kitchen-related activity requiring the use of the ChoppingBoard, using the BlackBarStool_B for seating or support.

      probability: 0.5
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.3
    - object: N/A
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency count of 91, which indicates strong interest from the user. It is also within a reasonable distance (1.869 meters) and has an approachable estimated time of 2.290 seconds, making it highly probable that the user will interact with it next.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: BlackBarStool_B has a decent focus consistency count of 28 and is slightly closer than the ChoppingBoard at 1.777 meters, with a similar approach time of 2.197 seconds. While it has lower focus counts compared to the ChoppingBoard, it still meets the criteria for distance and time thresholds effectively.
    - object: N/A
      reason: There are no other objects available that fit the thresholds closely enough to warrant a mention. Other objects, if present, must be significantly lower in both focus and distance counts, which disqualifies them from being likely interaction targets at this time.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B
    - N/A

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past interactions, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or engage in an activity that involves using the ChoppingBoard, possibly in combination with sitting on or using the BlackBarStool_B.

      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus count (50) as well as a strong proximity count (50), and it is also within close distance (1.015 meters). The time to approach is well within the threshold (2.86 seconds), making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock shows significant focus consistency (17 counts) and proximity consistency (50 counts), alongside a distance of 1.108 meters. Though it does not meet the focus threshold fully, it is still likely given the proximity and shorter distance.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no additional objects that meet the initial criteria sufficiently. Thus, we include a placeholder with a low probability to represent the absence of more likely candidates.

    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has the highest consistency in focus counts (31) and is within a proximity where the user is likely to interact with it (1.033 meters). It also has a very short time to approach (2.4 seconds), which makes it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: This object also has a high focus count (31) and is the closest object (1.004 meters). It has an estimated time to approach of just over 1 second, making it a strong candidate for interaction after the CoffeeCanisterLarge.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: While it has decent focus (17 counts), its distance (1.072 meters) and time to approach (114.4 seconds) place it lower on the list. Despite meeting the focus and distance thresholds, the significantly high time to approach means it's less likely to be interacted with compared to the previous two.

The attention to the WhiteUtensilTray also indicates a need for utensils, while the RedClock suggests a broader awareness of time management during this task.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object satisfied both distance (1.024 meters) and time thresholds (3.63 seconds), while also having a high focus count (48). The proximity counts match the user's predicted intentions, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: While the RedClock has a strong proximity consistency (48 counts) and adequate focus (17 counts), it does not meet the time threshold requirement (11.25 seconds). However, given its consistent attention, it is still considered the next likely object for interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: Since no additional objects showed potential for interaction based on the criteria, the prediction of "None" emphasizes the focus on the first two objects as the most likely candidates.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to retrieve or use the contents of the CoffeeCanisterLarge for a task, possibly involving making a beverage, while keeping track of time with the RedClock.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.65
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.1

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency with 84 counts, is at a proximity that meets the criteria, and has a time to approach that is below the threshold. This indicates that the user is likely focused on this object for interaction.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: BlackBarStool_B has relatively high focus and proximity counts, indicating the user has spent time observing it. However, it does not meet the time threshold. Still, it is within reach and may be a potential interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other objects in the context that meet the criteria sufficiently for consideration, thus maintaining a probability of 0.1 for no interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or engage in a cooking activity, as indicated by the high focus on the ChoppingBoard, which is commonly used for food preparation.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has the highest focus consistency count (48), is within a close distance (1.024 meters), and meets the time threshold for approaching (3.625 seconds). These factors suggest that the user is highly likely to interact with the CoffeeCanisterLarge soon.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a solid focus consistency (17 counts) and a close proximity (1.115 meters), but it does not meet the time threshold for approaching as effectively as the CoffeeCanisterLarge. It remains a likely object due to its proximity and some degree of attention from the user.
    - object: None
      reason: No other objects meet any of the criteria strongly enough to be considered for interaction outside the two identified. Thus, the probability for a third object is minimal.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare a beverage or snack in the living room, which requires accessing the CoffeeCanisterLarge while possibly checking the time on the RedClock.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has a high focus count (48) and distance is within a close range (1.024 meters), satisfying the focus and proximity thresholds. The approaching time of 3.63 seconds is also below the threshold of 4 seconds, making it the object the user is most likely to interact with.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a considerable focus count (17) and is also close in proximity (1.115 meters) but does not meet the time threshold (11.25 seconds). It satisfies the distance threshold but falls short on focus, making it likely but less probable than the CoffeeCanisterLarge.
    - object: None
      reason: While the other objects do not meet significant criteria, this category accounts for potential future consideration if the userâ€™s focus or proximity changes, or if new objects come into play.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions, it is inferred that the user is likely trying to prepare or consume coffee in the living room, as indicated by the high focus on the CoffeeCanisterLarge and proximity to the RedClock, possibly to check the time before starting their preparation.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.3
    - object: None
      probability: 0.1

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus count (48), meets proximity and time thresholds, making it the most likely object the user will interact with. Its close distance (1.024 meters) and comparatively low time to approach (3.63 seconds) further support this likelihood.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although the RedClock also has significant proximity counts and a close distance (1.115 meters), its focus count (17) is lower than that of the CoffeeCanisterLarge. As a result, it is less likely but still probable for interaction, especially since it meets the distance and time thresholds.
    - object: None
      reason: No other objects are present in this scenario that meet any interaction thresholds, making the probability for another object negligible.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or enjoy a beverage, possibly involving accessing the coffee canister while keeping an eye on the time as indicated by the presence of the clock.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.7
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.3
    - object: None
      probability: 0.0

rationale:
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has the highest proximity counts (91) indicating that the user is very close to it, supporting the likelihood of interaction. Additionally, its focus counts (15) are above the threshold, making it a strong candidate for interaction based on the user's behavior.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: Although the BlackBarStool_B has a high focus count (26), it does not have as strong proximity counts (11) compared to the RedClock. However, it still meets the focus threshold, making it a potential option for the user. Its time to approach is also reasonable, so it remains probable despite the lower proximity counts.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - RedClock
    - BlackBarStool_B

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and user behavior, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to check the time on the RedClock and may consider sitting on the BlackBarStool_B afterwards. The user seems to be navigating through the living room with specific intentions.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.4
    - object: null
      probability: 0.0

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has a high focus consistency count of 50, is at a close distance (1.015 meters), and has a short time to approach (2.86 seconds), clearly exceeding the thresholds for focus and time. The high proximity suggests it's a likely target for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has significant proximity and focus counts (17 for focus and 50 for proximity), but its time to approach (7.27 seconds) exceeds the threshold. Nonetheless, the combination of proximity and focus suggests it remains a probable target, though less likely than the CoffeeCanisterLarge.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past behaviors, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to gather or organize items in the Living Room, possibly involving the use of the CoffeeCanisterLarge for coffee or similar purposes, while observing the RedClock for timing or scheduling reasons.

    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The Coffee Canister has the highest focus consistency count (46) and is within a close distance (1.029 meters) with a quick approach time of approximately 4.85 seconds. It meets both distance and time thresholds, making it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The Red Clock has a high focus consistency count (17) and is also within a close distance (1.118 meters), but while it meets the distance threshold, it does not meet the time threshold as closely as the Coffee Canister. It remains a likely candidate for interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other objects that meet the criteria to be considered probable or likely for interaction beyond the first two, thus giving a small probability to the absence of an interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to retrieve or use items in the Living Room, primarily focusing on refreshments or items for a task that may require ingredient preparation or a time-related activity such as brewing.

    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.5
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.35
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has the highest focus count (31), is within the proximity threshold (1.033 meters), and has the shortest time to approach (approximately 2.4 seconds). It meets the focus, distance, and time thresholds, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The White Utensil Tray also meets the proximity threshold (1.004 meters) and the focus count (31), with a very short time to approach (approximately 1.1 seconds). It satisfies the focus and distance criteria, making it the second most likely object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although the Red Clock shows substantial focus (17 counts), it does not meet the time to approach threshold (114.4 seconds). It is within proximity (1.072 meters), which suggests it may still be considered for potential interaction. However, its relatively low focus and significant time to approach make it the least likely of the three.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - WhiteUtensilTray
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or interact with items related to food or drink in the Living Room, possibly getting coffee or organizing utensils.

    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.55
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.30
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has the highest focus (46 counts) and proximity consistency (46 counts), along with a short approach time (4.85 seconds), satisfying all thresholds for both focus and proximity. This indicates a strong likelihood that the user intends to interact with this object soon.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although the RedClock has a substantial focus count (17) and similar proximity count (46), it does not meet the time threshold for approach (22.89 seconds). Despite this, its high proximity indicates the user may have intentions to interact with it, making it the next likely candidate.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other objects that meet the interaction criteria sufficiently. The lack of a third object reflects that focus and proximity counts for any additional objects are considerably lower.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to retrieve something from the CoffeeCanisterLarge, possibly preparing a beverage, while keeping an eye on the RedClock, potentially to check the time while they work.

      probability: 0.5
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.3
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has the highest focus count (31) and is within a close distance (1.033 meters), with a very short time to approach (approximately 2.4 seconds). It meets the focus, distance, and time thresholds, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: Similar to the CoffeeCanisterLarge, the WhiteUtensilTray has a high focus count (31) and is very close (1.004 meters). It is also quick to approach (1.14 seconds). Thus, it satisfies the focus and distance thresholds and is likely to be the second most probable object.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although it has considerable focus and proximity counts, it does not meet the time threshold (114 seconds) for quick interaction. However, it still retains a significant focus and proximity consistency, making it a less likely but still possible object for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - WhiteUtensilTray
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and the monitoring of interactions with objects in the living room, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or organize something, as both the CoffeeCanisterLarge and WhiteUtensilTray suggest activities related to food or utensils. The presence of the RedClock may indicate a consideration of time or schedule in their activity.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.5
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.35
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge meets both distance and time thresholds while also exhibiting high focus consistency. With a short time to approach (approximately 2.4 seconds) and close proximity, it is the top candidate for interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The WhiteUtensilTray also meets the necessary distance and time thresholds with significant focus counts. Its proximity is slightly closer than the CoffeeCanisterLarge, making it a strong contender for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock does not meet the time threshold but has a high focus and proximity count. While less likely than the first two options due to the time constraint, the consistent attention suggests it could be a potential interaction target.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - WhiteUtensilTray
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or serve coffee, as indicated by the focus on the CoffeeCanisterLarge and nearby utensils, which suggests an activity involving kitchenware or food preparation.

    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.5
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.35
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object satisfies both the distance and time thresholds (1.033 meters and 2.4 seconds) and has the highest focus count at 31, indicating strong attention from the user.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: This object also meets the distance and time thresholds (1.004 meters and 1.1 seconds) and matches the focus count of 31, suggesting it is another object the user may interact with shortly.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although this object has a lower focus count of 17 and a longer time to approach (114.4 seconds), it is within proximity, and the user has shown some degree of focus on it, making it a less likely but still possible interaction.

      probability: 0.55
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.30
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus consistency count of 51 and is within a close distance of 0.982 meters. It also has a reasonable time to approach of approximately 3.5 seconds, indicating strong likelihood for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock shows a decent focus count of 17 and is also in close proximity at 1.062 meters. However, it doesn't meet the focus threshold as strongly as the CoffeeCanisterLarge, which makes it less likely to be interacted with. It has a longer time to approach, at about 6 seconds, slightly reducing its probability as well.
    - object: None
      reason: No other objects in the environment meet the minimum thresholds set for focus, distance, and time, making it unlikely that the user will interact with anything else.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.4
    - object: null
      probability: 0.0

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has a high focus count of 51 and proximity consistency of 60, which indicates significant attention from the user. Additionally, the distance is below the threshold, and the estimated time to approach is only 3.5 seconds, making it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock exhibits a focus count of 17 and proximity consistency of 60, which shows that while it has less focus compared to the CoffeeCanisterLarge, it is still a point of interest. It is slightly less likely than the CoffeeCanister because the focus count is lower, but it remains an option due to its consistent proximity and reasonable approach time.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions, it can be inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing or engaging with items in the living room, possibly involving refreshments or managing time-related tasks, evidenced by the focus on the coffee canister and clock.

    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has a high focus consistency count (91) and is very close to the user (1.869 meters) with a quick approach time (2.29 seconds). This indicates strong likelihood of interaction as the user has shown significant focus and proximity.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: The BlackBarStool_B, while showing lower focus consistency (28), is still within a reasonable distance (1.777 meters) and requires less time to approach (2.20 seconds). This suggests that it could still be a possible interaction, although it ranks lower than the ChoppingBoard.
    - object: None
      reason: No other objects met the criteria. The focus counts for nearby objects were not significant enough to warrant inclusion, indicating a likely focus on the two primary objects listed.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or engage in cooking activities, as the high focus on the ChoppingBoard suggests these tasks are central to their current intentions.

      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus (51 counts) and proximity counts (60 counts), and its approach time is below the threshold at 3.50 seconds, making it highly probable the user will interact with it.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has lower focus counts (17 counts) but meets the distance threshold (1.062 meters) and is approaching quickly at about 5.95 seconds. This partial focus with acceptable distance and time makes it the second most likely object for interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: No additional object meets the required thresholds adequately, hence a placeholder to indicate the lack of third choice.

      probability: 0.7
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.3
    - object: None
      probability: 0.0

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has high focus consistency (46 counts) and excellent proximity consistency (46 counts), and it is within a close distance (1.029 meters) with an approach time of only about 4.85 seconds. This satisfies all thresholds, making it the most likely object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a good focus consistency (17 counts) and strong proximity consistency (46 counts), but it barely meets the focus threshold (counts are below the 45 threshold) while meeting the distance and time criteria. Thus, it comes next in likelihood for interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other objects in the given context that meet the criteria for prediction since the focus and time thresholds are not met for any other objects.

predicted_interaction_objects:

    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: The BlackBarStool_B has lower focus counts (28) but is still in relatively close proximity. Its time to approach is almost within the acceptable threshold, indicating that the user might approach it for either seating or another purpose soon after interacting with the ChoppingBoard.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and the evident focus on the ChoppingBoard, along with its proximity, the user's goal appears to be related to food preparation or cooking, likely involving the use of the chopping board and possibly preparing to sit down at the bar stool afterwards.

      probability: 0.35
    - object: None
      probability: 0.05

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object satisfies the time threshold (4.84 seconds), the distance threshold (1.02 meters), and has a high focus consistency (46 counts). This indicates that the user is not only close to it but also has been focusing on it consistently, making it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although it meets the distance threshold (1.12 meters) and shows some focus counts (17 counts), it falls short of the time threshold (22.88 seconds to approach). However, it shows a significant count in proximity (46 counts) suggesting that the user may have been near it as well. Thus, it remains probable for interaction, though this probability is lower than the CoffeeCanisterLarge.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other objects in the vicinity that meet the minimum criteria for interaction based on the provided context, hence this third prediction holds a very low probability.

    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus counts (91) and a proximity count of 10, indicating that the user has been observing it very consistently. Although the proximity counts are not the highest, the significant focus suggests that the user is likely to interact with it next, especially if they are preparing food or cooking.
      
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: The BlackBarStool_B has a decent focus count (28) and proximity count (45), showing that while the user's focus is not as high as with the ChoppingBoard, they have spent a good amount of time near it. This suggests that it could serve as a temporary resting place or a vantage point while carrying out their tasks.
      
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other objects that closely fit the user's focus and proximity thresholds to warrant a prediction. The lack of a third object reflects that the user is primarily engaged with the two mentioned objects.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.5
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.35
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has the highest focus and proximity counts (31), which suggest a significant likelihood of interaction. Additionally, it has the shortest time to approach (2.4 seconds), making it very probable that the user will interact with this object soon.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The White Utensil Tray also has high focus and proximity counts (31), indicating that it has captured the user's attention as well. Its time to approach (1.1 seconds) is the lowest among the objects, supporting the likelihood of immediate interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The Red Clock has a lower focus count (17) in comparison to the other two objects but still shows significant proximity counts (31). However, it has a longer time to approach (114.4 seconds), which diminishes its chance of imminent interaction compared to the other objects.

    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.5
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.35
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object satisfies both focus and distance thresholds along with a very short approach time (2.4 seconds). Its high focus count (31) indicates that the user is paying close attention to it, making it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The White Utensil Tray has a matching focus and distance count (both are 31) and a very quick approach time (1.1 seconds). While it doesn't have as high a probability as the Coffee Canister, its proximity and focus suggest that it is the next most likely object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The Red Clock does not meet the time threshold (114.4 seconds to approach), but it has significant focus (17) and proximity counts (31). Although it does hold less priority due to the long approach time, it remains a possibility based on the user's focus on the object.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - WhiteUtensilTray
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past patterns, the user's goal likely involves preparing a beverage or arranging items in the living room, given the focus on both the Coffee Canister and Utensil Tray, which are typically involved in drink preparation or serving. The presence of the Red Clock may indicate the user also wants to be aware of time while accomplishing these tasks.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus and proximity counts (51 and 60 respectively) and a proximity distance of 0.982 meters, which is well within typical interaction distance. Additionally, it has a reasonable time to approach of 3.5 seconds, making it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has significant focus counts (17) and is also relatively close (1.062 meters) but falls short on the focus threshold. It does have proximity counts that suggest the user has spent some time near it, and the time to approach indicates it is a potential target for interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other objects that meet the criteria for prediction, so this slot is filled with a lower probability option to maintain the total sum of probabilities to 1.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to retrieve or check something from the CoffeeCanisterLarge, possibly for a beverage or snack preparation, while keeping an eye on the time displayed by the RedClock.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus (46 counts) and meets both the distance (1.029 meters) and time thresholds (4.84 seconds). The strong proximity and focus metrics indicate a high likelihood of interaction due to the user's intent to engage with this object.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a solid focus count (17 counts) and meets the distance threshold but does not satisfy the time threshold. Despite being less likely to interact with it due to a longer estimated approach time (22.89 seconds), its proximity and moderate focus suggest it is still a possible interaction choice.
    - object: None
      reason: No other object meets any of the criteria, hence it holds a minimal probability.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or consume something, possibly involving coffee, given the high focus and proximity to the CoffeeCanisterLarge in the living room context.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus consistency (46 counts) and a proximity consistency that matches (46 counts), indicating strong user interest. It also meets the distance threshold (1.029 meters) and has a short approach time (approximately 4.85 seconds), making it the most likely object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although the RedClock has a significant amount of focus consistency (17 counts) and proximity counts (46 counts), it fails to meet the time threshold. However, it has close proximity (1.118 meters), keeping it as a potential interaction due to its visibility and user attention.
    - object: None
      reason: No other objects within the environment are indicated in the current context as potential candidates for interaction, so "None" is included to complete the three-object prediction list.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and the absence of past prediction data, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to engage in an activity involving the CoffeeCanisterLarge, possibly related to preparing or consuming a beverage, while also keeping track of time with the RedClock.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.55
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.30
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest counts in both focus (51) and proximity (60), well above the focus threshold (30) and proximity threshold (60). Additionally, its approach time (3.50 seconds) meets the time threshold, making it the most likely object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock also has significant focus (17) and proximity (60) counts, although the focus count is just under the threshold. It is still within proximity (60) and the time to approach (5.95 seconds) is slightly above the threshold, making it the second most likely object.
    - object: None
      reason: No other objects are close enough in terms of counts to be considered; thus the remaining probability is assigned to 'None'. 

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to retrieve something from the coffee canister, possibly preparing a beverage, while also being aware of the time (as indicated by the presence of the RedClock).

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has the highest focus consistency (46 counts) and proximity consistency (46 counts), along with an approachable time of 4.85 seconds, making it highly probable for interaction as it exceeds the focus and proximity thresholds while meeting the time threshold.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although it has a high focus consistency (17 counts) and proximity consistency (46 counts), it falls short of the focus threshold but meets both the distance and time thresholds. It is still likely to be interacted with due to its proximity and the userâ€™s attention.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other objects that distinctly meet or provide partial satisfaction on the given thresholds. This leaves the last option as a lower-probability catch-all.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely focused on retrieving or utilizing something from the living room, possibly involving coffee preparation or checking the time.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.7
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.2
    - object: None
      probability: 0.1

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus count (46) and also meets the proximity count equivalently (46). Additionally, it has a time to approach of 4.85 seconds, which is below the threshold of 5 seconds, making it the most probable object of interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a high focus count (17) and a proximity count (46), but it spends more time to approach (22.89 seconds), which is above the desired threshold. This puts it in a secondary position for interaction but still makes it a candidate due to its consistency in the user's focus and proximity.
    - object: None
      reason: There are no other relevant objects that meet the criteria for interaction, hence a placeholder with minimal probability is assigned.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or consume coffee, as indicated by the high focus and proximity to the CoffeeCanisterLarge, along with the monitoring of the time for interaction with the RedClock, which may relate to timing or scheduling activities associated with making coffee.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.7
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.3
    - object: None
      probability: 0.0

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has a high focus consistency count of 46, a matching proximity count of 46, and a low time to approach of approximately 4.8 seconds, making it the most probable object for interaction. All criteria are satisfied, indicating it is the primary object of interest.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has a focus count of 17 and a proximity count of 46, but it does not quite meet the time threshold since it has a longer approach time of approximately 22.9 seconds. However, the significant proximity suggests the user is aware of it, making it a less likely but possible candidate for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions, it is inferred that the user is likely looking to obtain a coffee or interact with items relevant to their current activity in the living room, influenced by their focus and proximity to the CoffeeCanisterLarge and the RedClock.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.6
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.4
    - object: None
      probability: 0.0

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: CoffeeCanisterLarge satisfies both the focus (51 counts) and proximity (60 counts) thresholds, and it is also within the acceptable time threshold (3.5 seconds to approach). This indicates a high probability of interaction as the user has shown significant interest and remains close to it. 
    - object: RedClock
      reason: RedClock meets the distance and proximity thresholds (60 counts) but falls just short on focus (17 counts). However, since it is also within a feasible time to approach (5.9 seconds), it remains a probable candidate for interaction despite having lower focus counts compared to CoffeeCanisterLarge. 

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to retrieve or use something related to their coffee-making process in the Living Room, possibly preparing a drink or organizing items in that space, indicated by the strong focus on the CoffeeCanisterLarge and proximity to both objects.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:

      probability: 0.4
    - object: WoodenFork
      probability: 0.35
    - object: Mango_A
      probability: 0.25

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus counts at 90 and is the closest object at a distance of 1.026 meters, with an estimated time to approach of only 0.79 seconds. This clearly indicates high user interest and immediate accessibility for interaction.
    - object: WoodenFork
      reason: The WoodenFork follows closely with high focus counts at 91, a proximity measure indicative of frequent awareness, and a distance of 1.052 meters, which makes it approachable within a reasonable time frame of 1.43 seconds.
    - object: Mango_A
      reason: The Mango_A has lower focus counts compared to the first two but is still notable with counts of 91. Its distance is also favorable at 1.067 meters, and it has the shortest time to approach at 1.48 seconds, suggesting a likelihood of interaction despite lower focus counts.

      probability: 0.5
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.35
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency count (91) and is the closest object in focus, suggesting strong intent to interact with it. While it does not meet the time threshold, its high focus and proximity counts support a probable future interaction.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: BlackBarStool_B has lower focus consistency (28) but still shows significant proximity (45) counts and is relatively close to the user (1.777m), indicating that the user may be considering interaction despite not being as focused on it as the ChoppingBoard.
    - object: None
      reason: No other objects have enough data to suggest a reasonable chance of interaction, considering the thresholds set.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or engage in cooking activities, as indicated by the focus on the chopping board and proximity to seating (bar stool), suggesting the user may be transitioning between food preparation and meal consumption.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.65
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.1

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus (84 counts) and is very close to the user (1.999 meters), indicating a strong likelihood of interaction. Additionally, the approach time (around 3.46 seconds) is within the threshold, which reinforces the probability of interaction.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: The BlackBarStool_B shows significant focus (28 counts) and has a proximity count indicating the user has been near it (36 counts). However, it has a longer distance (1.817 meters) compared to the ChoppingBoard and a longer approach time (6.1 seconds), making it a less probable choice than the ChoppingBoard, yet still likely for interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: Since no other objects meet the given criteria, this option reflects the absence of further objects to consider for interaction. 

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B
    - None

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare food or engage in some form of cooking or food preparation, as indicated by the strong focus and proximity to the ChoppingBoard. The presence of the BlackBarStool_B suggests the user may also be planning to sit down or take a break in the process.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      probability: 0.6
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: ChoppingBoard
      reason: The ChoppingBoard has the highest focus consistency count of 84, indicating strong user interest. Although its proximity consistency is low (1 count), it is still within a reasonable distance of 1.999 meters, and the time to approach it (3.46 seconds) is under the threshold of 5 seconds. This combination of high focus and acceptable approach time makes it the most probable object for interaction.
    - object: BlackBarStool_B
      reason: The BlackBarStool_B has a focus count of 28 and a proximity count of 36, showing that the user has observed it sufficiently while remaining nearby. Its distance is slightly further (1.817 meters) and with an approach time of 6.1 seconds, it does not meet the time threshold. However, the moderate focus and proximity suggest it may still be a possible object of interest.
    - object: None
      reason: Since there are no other objects that meet the selection criteria significantly, this option indicates the low likelihood of additional interactions at this time.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - ChoppingBoard
    - BlackBarStool_B
    - None

      probability: 0.5
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.35
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge meets both the distance and time thresholds and has a high focus count, suggesting that the user is likely to interact with it soon. The proximity and low time to approach indicate a strong intent to use this object.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The WhiteUtensilTray also meets both the distance and time thresholds while having a significant focus count. This indicates that the user is close and likely contemplating interaction, making it a strong candidate for the next interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: Although the RedClock meets the distance and focus criteria, it fails to meet the time threshold. It has a relatively high count of focus and proximity but is less likely to be the next object of interaction compared to the first two. However, it may still be a consideration for the user based on previous patterns.

    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - WhiteUtensilTray
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and the context provided, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to prepare or enjoy a beverage in the living room. This is supported by the user's significant focus on the CoffeeCanisterLarge, suggesting they may be seeking coffee or tea, and the proximity to the WhiteUtensilTray, which could indicate a need for utensils or tools related to beverage preparation.

most_likely_objects_to_interact_with:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      probability: 0.7
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.3
    - object: None
      probability: 0.0

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus consistency count (46) and is within close proximity, with a distance of 1.029 meters and an approach time of about 4.85 seconds, all of which meet the provided thresholds, making it highly probable for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock, while being less frequently focused on (17 counts) and having a slightly larger distance of 1.118 meters with a longer approach time of 22.89 seconds, still meets the distance and time thresholds, which makes it the next likely candidate for interaction.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and the consistent focus and proximity towards the CoffeeCanisterLarge, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely to be making a coffee or preparing a beverage, with the RedClock possibly serving as a point of reference for timing their task.

      probability: 0.5
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.35
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: This object has the highest focus consistency (31 counts) and proximity consistency (31 counts), along with a very short time to approach (approximately 2.4 seconds). It satisfies both the focus and proximity thresholds, making it the most likely object for interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: Although this object has the same focus and proximity counts (31) as the CoffeeCanisterLarge, it is slightly further away (1.004 meters) and has a shorter time to approach (1.1 seconds). Despite this, its high focus and proximity consistency place it as the second most probable object for interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: This object does not meet the time threshold (approximately 114.4 seconds to approach), but it has substantial focus (17 counts) and proximity counts (31 counts). Due to these factors, it remains a possibility for interaction, though with lower probability than the other two objects.

      probability: 0.25
    - object: None
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has a very high focus consistency count of 46 and is also very close to the user (1.029 meters), making it highly probable that the user will interact with it. Additionally, the time to approach is within the acceptable threshold, further solidifying its prediction as the top candidate.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: While the RedClock does have significant proximity and focus counts, the focus count is lower than that of the CoffeeCanisterLarge. However, as the user is very close (1.118 meters) and has spent considerable time with it, it is still predicted to be the second most likely object for interaction.
    - object: None
      reason: No third object meets the criteria necessary for interaction. The focus and distance measurements for other potential objects are not strong enough to suggest interaction.

    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.35
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.15

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus and proximity counts, suggesting it is the object with which the user is most engaged and remains close to. It also has a low time to approach, indicating that the user can reach it quickly, making it the most probable interaction.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The WhiteUtensilTray meets the focus and proximity thresholds but has a slightly lower time to approach than the CoffeeCanisterLarge. The user has consistently focused on this object, and its proximity indicates a potential future interaction.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock shows significant focus and proximity counts but has a much longer time to approach compared to the first two objects. While it remains a possibility for interaction, it ranks lower due to these factors.

      probability: 0.5
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      probability: 0.3
    - object: RedClock
      probability: 0.2

rationale:
    - object: CoffeeCanisterLarge
      reason: The CoffeeCanisterLarge has the highest focus and proximity counts, indicating that the user has been consistently observing and staying close to it. This suggests a strong likelihood of interaction, especially since it also has a very low time to approach, making it highly probable that the user will reach for it soon.
    - object: WhiteUtensilTray
      reason: The WhiteUtensilTray also shows high focus and proximity counts, although slightly lower than the CoffeeCanisterLarge. It is within a very close distance, and the time to approach is minimal, supporting the likelihood of an interaction, albeit with a slightly lower probability than the CoffeeCanisterLarge.
    - object: RedClock
      reason: The RedClock has decent focus and proximity counts but does not meet the time threshold well, which reduces its likelihood. It is still a possible object of interaction due to consistent observation by the user, but its lower time to approach indicates it may not be the first choice compared to the other two objects.

predicted_interaction_objects:
    - CoffeeCanisterLarge
    - WhiteUtensilTray
    - RedClock

goal_of_the_user: Based on the current predictions and past ones from the previous_predictions list, it is inferred that the user's goal is likely related to preparing a beverage or organizing utensils, as the CoffeeCanisterLarge and WhiteUtensilTray are commonly associated with these tasks in a living room setting.
